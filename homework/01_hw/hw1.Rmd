Questions 1 and 2 below require no submission. Question 3 should be typed up __in your new editor of choice__ and [submitted via Canvas](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/75677/assignments/376966) as __a plain text file__ (file extension .txt). No Microsoft Word!

1. Install a text editor of your choice and look up the hot keys for all of the following commands:

* save, save all open files
* open file
* undo/redo
* go to particular line of code
* highlight a word/the next word/the line
* highlight all instances of a word
* copy/cut/paste words/lines
* duplicate lines

2. Install the following software on your computer:

__If you are on a Mac__

The following will walk you through the process of installing XCode tools and the [Homebrew package management system](https://brew.sh/) on your computer and setting the default shell to `bash`.

* Find the Terminal program on your computer. When it launches, copy/paste (using hotkeys?!) the following command and press `Return`.

```bash
xcode-select â€”install
```

* Copy/paste the following command and press `Return`.

```bash 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

* Once the installation completes, copy/paste the following two commands, one at a time.

```bash
brew upgrade  
brew install bash
```

* Once the installation completes, copy/paste the following command. You may be prompted to enter a password. This command will fail if you do not have administrative rights to your computer. Contact David if this is the case.

```bash
echo $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /private/etc/shells
```

* Finally, execute the following command, where you replace `your-username` with your actual user name. You may (again) be prompted for a password.

```bash
sudo chpass -s /usr/local/bin/bash $(whoami)
```

__If you are on a Windows machine__

* Follow the [video Sohail made](https://benkeser.github.io/info550/recordings/installing-wsl) to install Windows Subsystem for Linux.


3. Write a paragraph or two description of your workflow for the class project. Your description should include:

* a summary of what data will be used;
* what analyses will be performed on the data;
* what the output of the analysis will contain;
* software (including packages) that you need to complete your workflow.
