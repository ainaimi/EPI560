Nothing required to be turned in for question 1. For question 2, submit your Rmd code as plain text. 

1. Install the following software:

[TBD]

2. Start writing an R Markdown script for your project. The script can output whatever format you would like. For now, make sure that your script:
* does some sort of data cleaning;
* creates a nice looking table OR a figure (eventually, we'll need both);
* includes plain text description of the analysis and/or results.

It will benefit you to start thinking about what someone else would need to do in order to reproduce your script. In a couple weeks, we will be putting this script + data onto GitHub and asking your classmates to download it and run it themselves.
