	abstract = {The average causal effect compares counterfactual outcomes if everyone had been exposed versus if everyone had been unexposed, which can be an unrealistic contrast. Alternatively, we can target effects that compare counterfactual outcomes against the factual outcomes observed in the sample, i.e., we can compare against the natural course. Here, we demonstrate how the natural course can be estimated and used in causal analyses for model validation and effect estimation. Our example is an analysis assessing the impact of taking aspirin on pregnancy 26 weeks post-randomization in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial (2006--2012). To validate our models, we estimated the natural course using g-computation and then compared that against the observed incidence of pregnancy. We observed good agreement between the observed and model-based natural courses. We then estimated an effect that compared the natural course against the scenario where participants assigned to aspirin always complied. If women always complied, there would have been 5.0 (95{\%} confidence interval: 2.2, 7.8) more pregnancies per 100 women than was observed. It is good practice to estimate the natural course for model validation when using parametric models, but whether one should estimate a natural course contrast depends on the underlying research questions.},

	abstract = {Temporal trends in the prevalence of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection are uncertain because of the reluctance of most governments to embark on large-scale programmes of serological surveillance. In the absence of such data, attempts have been made to relate the number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in a defined population to the proportion of that population infected with the virus as a specified time point1--3. One crucial determinant of this relationship is the probability distribution of the incubation period of the disease, with the period defined as the time interval from infection to diagnosis. Recent statistical analysis suggests a mean incubation period of 4.5 years4 with wide confidence limits, whereas a more heuristic study reports a mean of 15 years5,6. Here we report on a new analysis which reveals age-related differences in the mean (and median) incubation period: 1.97(1.90) years for children (0--4 yrs old at infection), 8.23 (7.97) years for adults (5--59 yrs old), 5.50 (5.44) years for elderly patients (60 yrs and older).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is a prevalent condition, affecting 5-7{\%} of people aged 60 years and older, and a leading cause of disability in people aged 60 years and older globally. We aimed to examine the association between alcohol use disorders and dementia risk, with an emphasis on early-onset dementia (<65 years). METHODS: We analysed a nationwide retrospective cohort of all adult (≥20 years) patients admitted to hospital in metropolitan France between 2008 and 2013. The primary exposure was alcohol use disorders and the main outcome was dementia, both defined by International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision discharge diagnosis codes. Characteristics of early-onset dementia were studied among prevalent cases in 2008-13. Associations of alcohol use disorders and other risk factors with dementia onset were analysed in multivariate Cox models among patients admitted to hospital in 2011-13 with no record of dementia in 2008-10. FINDINGS: Of 31 624 156 adults discharged from French hospitals between 2008 and 2013, 1 109 343 were diagnosed with dementia and were included in the analyses. Of the 57 353 (5·2%) cases of early-onset dementia, most were either alcohol-related by definition (22 338 [38·9%]) or had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders (10 115 [17·6%]). Alcohol use disorders were the strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3·34 (95% CI 3·28-3·41) for women and 3·36 (3·31-3·41) for men. Alcohol use disorders remained associated with dementia onset for both sexes (adjusted hazard ratios >1·7) in sensitivity analyses on dementia case definition (including Alzheimer's disease) or older study populations. Also, alcohol use disorders were significantly associated with all other risk factors for dementia onset (all p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Alcohol use disorders were a major risk factor for onset of all types of dementia, and especially early-onset dementia. Thus, screening for heavy drinking should be part of regular medical care, with intervention or treatment being offered when necessary. Additionally, other alcohol policies should be considered to reduce heavy drinking in the general population. FUNDING: None.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between the Life Simple 7 cardiovascular health score at age 50 and incidence of dementia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study; study inception 1985-88). PARTICIPANTS: 7899 participants with data on the cardiovascular health score at age 50. EXPOSURES: The cardiovascular health score included four behavioural (smoking, diet, physical activity, body mass index) and three biological (fasting glucose, blood cholesterol, blood pressure) metrics, coded on a three point scale (0, 1, 2). The cardiovascular health score was the sum of seven metrics (score range 0-14) and was categorised into poor (scores 0-6), intermediate (7-11), and optimal (12-14) cardiovascular health. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident dementia, identified through linkage to hospital, mental health services, and mortality registers until 2017. RESULTS: 347 incident cases of dementia were recorded over a median follow-up of 24.7 years. Compared with an incidence rate of dementia of 3.2 (95% confidence interval 2.5 to 4.0) per 1000 person years among the group with poor cardiovascular health, the absolute rate differences per 1000 person years were -1.5 (95% confidence interval -2.3 to -0.7) for the group with intermediate cardiovascular health and -1.9 (-2.8 to -1.1) for the group with optimal cardiovascular health. Higher cardiovascular health score was associated with a lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio 0.89 (0.85 to 0.95) per 1 point increment in the cardiovascular health score). Similar associations with dementia were observed for the behavioural and biological subscales (hazard ratios per 1 point increment in the subscores 0.87 (0.81 to 0.93) and 0.91 (0.83 to 1.00), respectively). The association between cardiovascular health at age 50 and dementia was also seen in people who remained free of cardiovascular disease over the follow-up (hazard ratio 0.89 (0.84 to 0.95) per 1 point increment in the cardiovascular health score). CONCLUSION: Adherence to the Life Simple 7 ideal cardiovascular health recommendations in midlife was associated with a lower risk of dementia later in life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the main treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but patients' long-term outcome is still challenging. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of long-term survival in patients after lung cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for NSCLC from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009, were enrolled into this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the survival length after surgery. Predictors of long-term survival were screened with the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Postoperative follow-up was completed in 588 patients with a median follow-up duration of 5.2 years (interquartile range, 2.0-6.8). Two hundred ninety-one patients (49.5%) survived at the end of follow-up with median survival duration of 64.3 months (interquartile range, 28.5-81.6). The overall survival rates were 90.8%, 70.0%, and 57.1% at the end of the first, third, and fifth year after surgery, respectively. Limited resection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.98; P = .013) and large tumor size (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001) were associated with short survival; whereas high body mass index grade (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.97; P = .021), highly differentiated tumor (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.93; P = .024), dissection of mediastinal lymph node during surgery (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.67; P < .001), and perioperative use of dexamethasone (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90; P = .006) were associated with long survival. No association was found between perioperative use of flurbiprofen axetil and long survival (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62-1.03; P = .086). However, combined administration of dexamethasone and flurbiprofen axetil was associated with longer survival (compared to no use of both: adjusted HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.84; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Certain factors in particular perioperative dexamethasone and flurbiprofen axetil therapy may improve patients' long-term survival after surgery for NSCLC. Given the small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and randomized clinical trials are needed for further clarification.},

	abstract = {Consistency of the propensity score estimators rely on correct specification of the propensity score model. The propensity score is frequently estimated using a main effect logistic regression. It has recently been shown that the use of ensemble machine learning algorithms, such as the Super Learner, could improve covariate balance and reduce bias in a meaningful manner in the case of serious model misspecification for treatment assignment. However, the loss functions normally used by the Super Learner may not be appropriate for propensity score estimation since the goal in this problem is not to optimize propensity score prediction but rather to achieve the best possible balance in the covariate distribution between treatment groups. In a simulation study, we evaluated the benefit of a modification of the Super Learner by propensity score estimation geared toward achieving covariate balance between the treated and untreated after matching on the propensity score. Our simulation study included six different scenarios characterized by various degrees of deviation from the usual main term logistic model for the true propensity score and outcome as well as the presence (or not) of instrumental variables. Our results suggest that the use of this adapted Super Learner to estimate the propensity score can further improve the robustness of propensity score matching estimators.},

@article{McCaffrey2013,
	abstract = {The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non-randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to provide step-by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. We also provide tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments. A case study examining the effects of three treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse demonstrates the methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to mercury (Hg) is associated with adverse developmental effects. However, Hg occurs with a multitude of chemicals. We assessed the associations of developmental exposure to multiple pollutants with children's neurodevelopment using a novel approach. Methods: Hg, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were measured in maternal and children's blood at 5 years (n = 449 and 419). At 7 years, children were administered Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). We used the G-formula combined with SuperLearner to estimate independent and joint effects of chemicals at both ages. We constructed flexible exposure-response relationships and assessed interactions. Results: Most chemicals showed negative relationships with BNT scores. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in maternal Hg and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was associated with 0.15 standard deviation (SD) (95% confidence interval [CI] = --0.29, --0.03) and 0.14 SD (95% CI = --0.26, --0.05) lower scores in BNT, whereas a joint IQR increase in the mixture of chemicals was associated with 0.48 SD (95% CI = --0.69, --0.25) lower scores in BNT. An IQR increase in PFOA was associated with 0.11 SD (95% CI = 0.02, 0.26) higher total SDQ difficulties scores. Maternal ∑PCBs concentrations were associated with lower SDQ scores (β = --0.09 SD; 95% CI = --0.19, 0), whereas 5 years ∑PCBs showed a negative association (β = --0.09 SD; 95% CI = --0.21, 0). Finally, a joint IQR increase in the mixture was associated with 0.22 SD (95% CI = 0.04, 0.4) higher SDQ scores. Conclusions: Using a novel statistical approach, we confirmed associations between prenatal mercury exposure and lower cognitive function. The potential developmental effects of PFASs need additional attention.},

We build on a previous nonparametric likelihood approach and propose new doubly robust estimators, which have desirable properties in efficiency if the propensity score model is correctly specified, and in boundedness even if the inverse probability weights are highly variable. We compare the new and existing estimators in a simulation study and find that the robustified likelihood estimators yield overall the smallest mean squared errors.},

	abstract = {The development of coherent missing data models to account for nonmonotone missing at random (MAR) data by inverse probability weighting (IPW) remains to date largely unresolved. As a consequence, IPW has essentially been restricted for use only in monotone missing data settings. We propose a class of models for nonmonotone missing data mechanisms that spans the MAR model, while allowing the underlying full data law to remain unrestricted. For parametric specifications within the proposed class, we introduce an unconstrained maximum likelihood estimator for estimating the missing data probabilities which can be easily implemented using existing software. To circumvent potential convergence issues with this procedure, we also introduce a Bayesian constrained approach to estimate the missing data process which is guaranteed to yield inferences that respect all model restrictions. The efficiency of the standard IPW estimator is improved by incorporating information from incomplete cases through an augmented estimating equation which is optimal within a large class of estimating equations. We investigate the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators in a simulation study and illustrate the new methodology in an application evaluating key correlates of preterm delivery for infants born to HIV infected mothers in Botswana, Africa.},

	abstract = {Missing data are common in medical and social science studies and often pose a serious challenge in data analysis. Multiple imputation methods are popular and natural tools for handling missing data, replacing each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the underlying values. We consider a case of missing at random (MAR) and investigate the estimation of the marginal mean of an outcome variable in the presence of missing values when a set of fully observed covariates is available. We propose a new nonparametric multiple imputation (MI) approach that uses two working models to achieve dimension reduction and define the imputing sets for the missing observations. Compared with existing nonparametric imputation procedures, our approach can better handle covariates of high dimension, and is doubly robust in the sense that the resulting estimator remains consistent if either of the working models is correctly specified. Compared with existing doubly robust methods, our nonparametric MI approach is more robust to the misspecification of both working models; it also avoids the use of inverse-weighting and hence is less sensitive to missing probabilities that are close to 1. We propose a sensitivity analysis for evaluating the validity of the working models, allowing investigators to choose the optimal weights so that the resulting estimator relies either completely or more heavily on the working model that is likely to be correctly specified and achieves improved efficiency. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, and perform simulation studies to show that the proposed method compares favorably with some existing methods in finite samples. The proposed method is further illustrated using data from a colorectal adenoma study.},

Under the assumption that the treatment is ignorable given some observed characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is ancillary for estimation of the average treatment effects. The propensity score is not ancillary for estimation of average treatment effects on the treated. It is suggested that the marginal value of the propensity score lies entirely in the "dimension reduction." Efficient semiparametric estimators of average treatment effects and average treatment effects on the treated are shown to take the form of relevant sample averages of the data completed by the nonparametric imputation method. It is shown that the projection on the propensity score is not necessary for efficient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects on the treated even if the propensity score is known. An application to the experimental data reveals that conditioning on the propensity score may even result in a loss of efficiency.{$]$}},

However, existing programs that implement doubly robust estimators do not all support machine learning methods and cross-fitting, or provide estimates on multiplicative scales. To address these needs, we developed the AIPW package implementing the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimation of average causal effects in R. Key features of the AIPW package includes cross-fitting and flexible covariate adjustment for observational studies and randomized trials (RCTs). In this paper, we use a simulated RCT to present the implementation of the AIPW estimator. We also perform a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the AIPW package compared with other doubly robust implementations including CausalGAM, npcausal, tmle, and tmle3. Our simulation shows that the AIPW package yielded comparable performance to other programs. Furthermore, we also found that cross-fitting substantively decreases the bias and improves the confidence interval coverage for doubly robust estimators fit with machine learning algorithms. Our findings suggest that the AIPW package can be a useful tool for estimating average causal effects with machine learning methods in RCTs and observational studies.},

If accurate tests can be identified, a potentially effective screening strategy with an adjunct preventive therapy may be trialled to reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm birth or effective measures be deployed at an early stage of a suspected spontaneous preterm labour before the onset of cervical changes to ameliorate prematurity complications. RECENT FINDINGS: There are many tests predicting spontaneous preterm births, published in the literature individually or in a systematic review. The information has not been collated about all candidate tests simultaneously in a systematic review incorporating a framework on how these tests may be evaluated, modelled with an intervention to provide a number needed to treat and test to inform decision-making. SUMMARY: There were 319 studies evaluating 22 tests. There are many promising tests, for example, history of previous spontaneous preterm birth, cervicovaginal swabs for markers such as fibronectin or HCG, cervical ultrasound, serum CRP and amniotic fluid interleukins for predicting spontaneous preterm birth, but none have exceptional accuracy and the quality of studies was generally poor. Some tests were able to achieve high LR+, but at the expense of LR-, that is, tests good for ruling in disease were poor for ruling out disease and vice versa.},

@article{Zheng2018,
	abstract = {Binary classification problems are ubiquitous in health and social sciences. In many cases, one wishes to balance two competing optimality considerations for a binary classifier. For instance, in resource-limited settings, an human immunodeficiency virus prevention program based on offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to select high-risk individuals must balance the sensitivity of the binary classifier in detecting future seroconverters (and hence offering them PrEP regimens) with the total number of PrEP regimens that is financially and logistically feasible for the program. In this article, we consider a general class of constrained binary classification problems wherein the objective function and the constraint are both monotonic with respect to a threshold. These include the minimization of the rate of positive predictions subject to a minimum sensitivity, the maximization of sensitivity subject to a maximum rate of positive predictions, and the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, which minimizes the type II error subject to an upper bound on the type I error. We propose an ensemble approach to these binary classification problems based on the Super Learner methodology. This approach linearly combines a user-supplied library of scoring algorithms, with combination weights and a discriminating threshold chosen to minimize the constrained optimality criterion. We then illustrate the application of the proposed classifier to develop an individualized PrEP targeting strategy in a resource-limited setting, with the goal of minimizing the number of PrEP offerings while achieving a minimum required sensitivity. This proof of concept data analysis uses baseline data from the ongoing Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health study. Copyright {\copyright} 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We discuss an implementation of an AUC-maximization technique that is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. We also evaluate the effectiveness of a large number of different nonlinear optimization algorithms to maximize the cross-validated AUC of the ensemble fit. The results provide evidence that AUC-maximizing metalearners can, and often do, out-perform non-AUC-maximizing metalearning methods, with respect to ensemble AUC.

No study has examined the ability of tree-based methods to detect epistasis in the presence of a polygenic signal. We sought to apply decision tree-based methods, C5.0 and logic regression, to detect epistasis under several simulated conditions, varying strength of interaction and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure. We then applied the same methods to the phenotype of educational attainment in a large population cohort. RESULTS: LD pruning improved the power and reduced the type I error. C5.0 had a conservative type I error rate whereas logic regression had a type I error rate that exceeded 5{\%}. Despite the more conservative type I error, C5.0 was observed to have higher power than logic regression across several conditions. In the presence of a polygenic signal, power was generally reduced. Applying both methods on educational attainment in a large population cohort yielded numerous interacting SNPs; notably a SNP in RCAN3 which is associated with reading and spelling and a SNP in NPAS3, a neurodevelopmental gene.

	abstract = {There is an active debate in the literature on censored data about the relative performance of model based maximum likelihood estimators, IPCW-estimators, and a variety of double robust semiparametric efficient estimators. Kang and Schafer (2007) demonstrate the fragility of double robust and IPCW-estimators in a simulation study with positivity violations. They focus on a simple missing data problem with covariates where one desires to estimate the mean of an outcome that is subject to missingness. Responses by Robins, et al. (2007), Tsiatis and Davidian (2007), Tan (2007) and Ridgeway and McCaffrey (2007) further explore the challenges faced by double robust estimators and offer suggestions for improving their stability. In this article, we join the debate by presenting targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). We demonstrate that TMLEs that guarantee that the parametric submodel employed by the TMLE procedure respects the global bounds on the continuous outcomes, are especially suitable for dealing with positivity violations because in addition to being double robust and semiparametric efficient, they are substitution estimators. We demonstrate the practical performance of TMLEs relative to other estimators in the simulations designed by Kang and Schafer (2007) and in modified simulations with even greater estimation challenges.},

	abstract = {When causal inference is of primary interest, a range of target parameters can be chosen to define the causal effect, such as average treatment effects (ATEs). However, ATEs may not always align with the research question at hand. Furthermore, the assumptions needed to interpret estimates as ATEs, such as exchangeability, consistency, and positivity, are often not met. Here, we present the incremental propensity score (PS) approach to quantify the effect of shifting each person's exposure propensity by some predetermined amount. Compared with the ATE, incremental PS may better reflect the impact of certain policy interventions and do not require that positivity hold. Using the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b), we quantified the relationship between total vegetable intake and the risk of preeclampsia and compared it to average treatment effect estimates. The ATE estimates suggested a reduction of between two and three preeclampsia cases per 100 pregnancies for consuming at least half a cup of vegetables per 1,000 kcal. However, positivity violations obfuscate the interpretation of these results. In contrast, shifting each woman's exposure propensity by odds ratios ranging from 0.20 to 5.0 yielded no difference in the risk of preeclampsia. Our analyses show the utility of the incremental PS effects in addressing public health questions with fewer assumptions.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods.},

	abstract = {{$[$}The intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of the primary outcome plays a key role in the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs), but the precise definition of this parameter is somewhat elusive, especially in the context of non-normally distributed outcomes. In this paper, we provide a unified treatment of ICC as used in CRTs. We present a general definition of the ICC that may be expressed in different ways depending on the modelling approach used to describe the data, illustrating how this general definition is applied to continuous and dichotomous outcomes. Greater complexity arises for dichotomous outcomes; in particular, the usual definition of the ICC cannot be related directly to the parameters of the logistic-normal model that is commonly used for dichotomous outcomes. We show how the definition of the ICC is different when covariates are introduced. Finally, we use our framework and definition of the ICC to draw out implications for those interpreting and choosing values of the ICC when planning CRTs.

Section 4 gives a brief description of his work in the analysis of contingency tables. In Section 5, there is a summary of his views on a number of issues relating to the research, mostly case-control studies, on the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The discussion in this section is selective and undoubtedly does not reflect all the important things he had to say on the subject.

Under "incidence-density" sampling, in which controls are selected from those at risk at the time of onset of each case, the matched estimator is shown to be consistent. In contrast, the unmatched estimator is biased unless the proportion exposed in the population at risk is constant over the study period; the bias is, however, negligible unless there is very large variation in the proportion exposed. No assumption of rarity of the disease is needed for these results. On the other hand, when the risk ratio is the parameter of interest, the assumption of rarity is needed for the odds ratio to be a consistent estimator. In such situations, the odds ratio obtained under "incidence-density" sampling will in general provide a better approximation to the risk ratio than will the odds ratio obtained under "cumulative-incidence" sampling, in which controls are selected from those still unaffected at the end of the study period. Even if the disease is rare, however, the odds ratio obtained under cumulative sampling need not consistently estimate any parameter of interest unless the proportion exposed is approximately constant.},

Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent observational studies suggest that various drugs are remarkably effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These cohort studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis which can lead to immortal time bias. We describe the bias from 20 of these studies and illustrate it by showing that unrelated drugs can be made to appear effective at treating cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: The illustration used a cohort of 3315 patients, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), identified from the Saskatchewan Health databases, hospitalised for CVD and followed for up to a year. We used the biased approach to assess the effect of two medications, namely gastrointestinal drugs (GID) and inhaled beta-agonists (IBA), both unknown to be effective in CVD, on the risk of all-cause mortality. We also estimated these effects using the proper person-time approach. RESULTS: Using the inappropriate approach, the rates ratios of all-cause death were 0.73 (95%CI: 0.57-0.93), with IBA and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.61-0.99), with GID. These rate ratios became 0.98 (95%CI: 0.77-1.25) and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.73-1.20), respectively, with the proper person-time analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Several recent observational studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis, leading to immortal time bias, which can generate an illusion of treatment effectiveness. Observational studies, with surprising beneficial drug effects should be re-assessed to account for this source of bias.},

	abstract = {For estimating causal effects of treatments, randomized experiments are generally considered the gold standard. Nevertheless, they are often infeasible to conduct for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, excessive expense, or timeliness. Consequently, much of our knowledge of causal effects must come from non-randomized observational studies. This article will advocate the position that observational studies can and should be designed to approximate randomized experiments as closely as possible. In particular, observational studies should be designed using only background information to create subgroups of similar treated and control units, where 'similar' here refers to their distributions of background variables. Of great importance, this activity should be conducted without any access to any outcome data, thereby assuring the objectivity of the design. In many situations, this objective creation of subgroups of similar treated and control units, which are balanced with respect to covariates, can be accomplished using propensity score methods. The theoretical perspective underlying this position will be presented followed by a particular application in the context of the US tobacco litigation. This application uses propensity score methods to create subgroups of treated units (male current smokers) and control units (male never smokers) who are at least as similar with respect to their distributions of observed background characteristics as if they had been randomized. The collection of these subgroups then 'approximate' a randomized block experiment with respect to the observed covariates.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a na{\"\i}ve model‐based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich‐type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. {\copyright}2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

@article{Muller2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We review three common methods to estimate predicted probabilities following confounder-adjusted logistic regression: marginal standardization (predicted probabilities summed to a weighted average reflecting the confounder distribution in the target population); prediction at the modes (conditional predicted probabilities calculated by setting each confounder to its modal value); and prediction at the means (predicted probabilities calculated by setting each confounder to its mean value). That each method corresponds to a different target population is underappreciated in practice. Specifically, prediction at the means is often incorrectly interpreted as estimating average probabilities for the overall study population, and furthermore yields nonsensical estimates in the presence of dichotomous confounders. Default commands in popular statistical software packages often lead to inadvertent misapplication of prediction at the means. METHODS: Using an applied example, we demonstrate discrepancies in predicted probabilities across these methods, discuss implications for interpretation and provide syntax for SAS and Stata. RESULTS: Marginal standardization allows inference to the total population from which data are drawn. Prediction at the modes or means allows inference only to the relevant stratum of observations. With dichotomous confounders, prediction at the means corresponds to a stratum that does not include any real-life observations. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal standardization is the appropriate method when making inference to the overall population. Other methods should be used with caution, and prediction at the means should not be used with binary confounders. Stata, but not SAS, incorporates simple methods for marginal standardization.},

The methodology, training, and quality assurance activities employed are described. The study population, enrolled between October 1994 and November 1995 through six clinical consortia throughout the United States (totaling 23 sites) represents a typically hard-to-reach study population. More than half of the women in each cohort were living below the federally defined levels of poverty. The women ranged in age from 16 to 73 years; approximately one-quarter self-identified as Latina or Hispanic, over one-half as African-American not of Hispanic origin, and less than 20% as white, non-Hispanic origin. Self-reporting of HIV exposure risk included injection drug use by 34% of the seropositive women and 28% of the seronegative women, heterosexual contact (42% vs 26%), transfusion risk (4% vs 3%) and no identified risk (20% vs 43%). Demographic and HIV exposure risk characteristics of the seropositive cohort were comparable with characteristics of nationally reported AIDS cases in U.S. women. This well characterized cohort of HIV-seropositive and high-risk seronegative women represents a rich opportunity for future studies of HIV disease progression and pathogenesis.},

Human factors have expanded what might otherwise have been narrow technical discussions into broad philosophical debates. There seem to be misconceptions about the requirements and capabilities of formal methods, especially in notions that certain assumptions or models (such as potential-outcome models) are necessary or sufficient for valid inference. I argue that, once these misconceptions are removed, most elements of the opposing views can be reconciled. The chief problem of causal inference then becomes one of how to teach sound use of formal methods (such as causal modeling, statistical inference, and sensitivity analysis), and how to apply them without generating the overconfidence and misinterpretations that have ruined so many statistical practices.},

	n2 = {The assessment of direct and indirect effects with time-varying mediators and confounders is a common but challenging problem, and standard mediation analysis approaches are generally not applicable in this context. The mediational g-formula was recently proposed to address this problem, paired with a semiparametric estimation approach to evaluate longitudinal mediation effects empirically. In this article, we develop a parametric estimation approach to the mediational g-formula, including a feasible algorithm implemented in a freely available SAS macro. In the Framingham Heart Study data, we apply this method to estimate the interventional analogues of natural direct and indirect effects of smoking behaviors sustained over a 10-year period on blood pressure when considering weight change as a time-varying mediator. Compared with not smoking, smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.2 mm Hg (95{\%} CI: −0.7, 2.7). The direct effect was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.5 mm Hg (95{\%} CI: −0.3, 2.9), and the indirect effect was −0.3 mm Hg (95{\%} CI: −0.5, −0.1), which is negative because smoking which is associated with lower weight is associated in turn with lower blood pressure. These results provide evidence that weight change in fact partially conceals the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on blood pressure. Our study represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the parametric mediational g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study (see video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B159 .)},

Although the principal estimator of MSM coefficients has been the inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) estimator, there are few published examples that illustrate how to apply IPTW or discuss the impact of model selection on effect estimates. The authors applied IPTW estimation of an MSM to observational data from the Fresno Asthmatic Children's Environment Study (2000-2002) to evaluate the effect of asthma rescue medication use on pulmonary function and compared their results with those obtained through traditional regression methods. Akaike's Information Criterion and cross-validation methods were used to fit the MSM. In this paper, the influence of model selection and evaluation of key assumptions such as the experimental treatment assignment assumption are discussed in detail. Traditional analyses suggested that medication use was not associated with an improvement in pulmonary function--a finding that is counterintuitive and probably due to confounding by symptoms and asthma severity. The final MSM estimated that medication use was causally related to a 7% improvement in pulmonary function. The authors present examples that should encourage investigators who use IPTW estimation to undertake and discuss the impact of model-fitting procedures to justify the choice of the final weights.},

	abstract = {One hundred years ago Sir Ronald Ross published his treatise on a general Theory of Happenings. Dependent happenings are those in which the frequency depends on the number already affected. When there is dependency of events, interventions can have different types of effects. Interventions such as vaccination can have direct protective effects for the person receiving the treatment, as well as indirect/spillover effects for others in the population. Causal inference is a framework for carefully defining the causal effect of a treatment, exposure, or policy, and then determining conditions under which such effects can be estimated from the observed data. We consider here scenarios in which the potential outcomes of an individual can depend on the treatment of other individuals in the population, known as causal inference with interference. Much of the research so far has assumed the population is divided into groups or clusters, and individuals can interfere with others within their clusters but not across clusters. Recent developments have assumed more general forms of interference. We review some of the different types of effects that have been defined for dependent happenings, particularly using the methods of causal inference with interference. Many of the methods are applicable across disciplines, such as infectious diseases, social sciences, and economics.},

@article{Edwards2016,
	abstract = {Traditional epidemiologic approaches allow us to compare counterfactual outcomes under 2 exposure distributions, usually 100% exposed and 100% unexposed. However, to estimate the population health effect of a proposed intervention, one may wish to compare factual outcomes under the observed exposure distribution to counterfactual outcomes under the exposure distribution produced by an intervention. Here, we used inverse probability weights to compare the 5-year mortality risk under observed antiretroviral therapy treatment plans to the 5-year mortality risk that would had been observed under an intervention in which all patients initiated therapy immediately upon entry into care among patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus in the US Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems multisite cohort study between 1998 and 2013. Therapy-naive patients (n = 14,700) were followed from entry into care until death, loss to follow-up, or censoring at 5 years or on December 31, 2013. The 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 11.65% under observed treatment plans and 10.10% under the intervention, yielding a risk difference of -1.57% (95% confidence interval: -3.08, -0.06). Comparing outcomes under the intervention with outcomes under observed treatment plans provides meaningful information about the potential consequences of new US guidelines to treat all patients with human immunodeficiency virus regardless of CD4 cell count under actual clinical conditions.},

@article{Vrijens1997,
	abstract = {When two equally efficacious drugs enter the market, the one with the better compliance is likely to be more widely used. Special management of the delivery may produce increased compliance. In this paper we analyze a trial of a single drug dosing prescription with patients randomized to either daily self monitoring of the outcome (blood pressure) or not. The study used Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) to record each exact time and date when a patient opened the pill container. No established method is available for comparing these high-dimensional compliance patterns between groups. This paper investigates several summary measures that highlight different dimensions of the pattern and the drug context in which they may be meaningful. Further, we examine conditional and marginal models that enable comparisons of the full pattern of daily dosing indicators for subjects between the groups. We found no simple difference in average compliance levels, but we found an interesting interaction between treatment and time: similar compliance existed initially among patients in both randomized groups, with a stronger decline over time for patients who did not monitor their blood pressure. We discuss how a balance between simplicity of interpretation and efficiency of data use may be sought in this case.},

Given that compliance measures are rarely, if ever, error-free indicators of exposure it is argued that both the designs for the collection of compliance data and the statistical models for their resulting analysis should be changed to take the possibility of measurement error into account. An analysis which ignores measurement error in the compliance measurements will provide biased estimates of compliance-response relationships. Provided that one has two or more indicators of compliance for each subject, more appropriate models can be fitted using covariance structure modelling software. If one wishes to explore interactions from repeated measures data on both compliance and response then it is also important that one recognizes that the response measures are also error-prone and that they too are dealt with appropriately.},

	abstract = {We argue, that due to the curse of dimensionality, there are major difficulties with any pure or smoothed likelihood-based method of inference in designed studies with randomly missing data when missingness depends on a high-dimensional vector of variables. We study in detail a semi-parametric superpopulation version of continuously stratified random sampling. We show that all estimators of the population mean that are uniformly consistent or that achieve an algebraic rate of convergence, no matter how slow, require the use of the selection (randomization) probabilities. We argue that, in contrast to likelihood methods which ignore these probabilities, inverse selection probability weighted estimators continue to perform well achieving uniform n 1/2-rates of convergence. We propose a curse of dimensionality appropriate (CODA) asymptotic theory for inference in non- and semi-parametric models in an attempt to formalize our arguments. We discuss whether our results constitute a fatal blow to the likelihood principle and study the attitude toward these that a committed subjective Bayesian would adopt. Finally, we apply our CODA theory to analyse the effect of the 'curse of dimensionality' in several interesting semi-parametric models, including a model for a two-armed randomized trial with randomization probabilities depending on a vector of continuous pretreatment covariates X. We provide substantive settings under which a subjective Bayesian would ignore the randomization probabilities in analysing the trial data. We then show that any statistician who ignores the randomization probabilities is unable to construct nominal 95 per cent confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that have both: (i) an expected length which goes to zero with increasing sample size; and (ii) a guaranteed expected actual coverage rate of at least 95 per cent over the ensemble of trials analysed by the statistician during his or her lifetime. However, we derive a new interval estimator, depending on the Randomization probabilities, that satisfies (i) and (ii).},

@article{Naimi2016c,
	abstract = {Social epidemiologists often seek to determine the mechanisms that underlie health disparities. This work is typically based on mediation procedures that may not be justified with exposures of common interest in social epidemiology. In this analysis, we explored the consequences of using standard approaches, referred to as the difference and generalized product methods, when mediator-outcome confounders are associated with the exposure. We compared these with inverse probability-weighted marginal structural models, the structural transformation method, doubly robust g-estimation of a structural nested model, and doubly robust targeted minimum loss-based estimation. We used data on 900,726 births from 2003 to 2007 in the Penn Moms study, conducted in Pennsylvania, to assess the extent to which breastfeeding prior to hospital discharge explained the racial disparity in infant mortality. Overall, for every 1,000 births, 3.36 more infant deaths occurred among non-Hispanic black women relative to all other women (95% confidence interval: 2.78, 3.93). Using the difference and generalized product methods to assess the disparity that would remain if everyone breastfed prior to discharge suggested a complete elimination of the disparity (risk difference = −0.87 per 1,000 births; 95% confidence interval: −1.39, −0.35). In contrast, doubly robust methods suggested a reduction in the disparity to 2.45 (95% confidence interval: 2.20, 2.71) more infant deaths per 1,000 births among non-Hispanic black women. Standard approaches for mediation analysis in health disparities research can yield misleading results.},

@article{Greenland2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized trials provide pivotal evidence for evaluation and approval of therapies. Nonetheless, such trials are often plagued by noncompliance, especially in the form of premature discontinuation of treatment. While intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis can provide valid tests of no-effect hypotheses, some trials may make ITT analysis impossible by ceasing follow-up when patients go off assigned treatment. Furthermore, estimates based on ITT, on-treatment, or per-protocol comparisons can seriously understate harm or benefit. PURPOSE: To show how g-estimation based on randomization status is a natural generalization of ITT null testing to estimating efficacy from trials with important discontinuation or noncompliance. METHODS: We contrast with an analysis of the effect of a tiotropium inhaler on the occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) events in a six-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 1829 patients with good but imperfect compliance. RESULTS: The covariate-adjusted point estimates, 95% confidence limits (CL), and null P-values comparing expected COPD event times in placebo versus tiotropium patients were: ITT, 1.21, CL = 1.02, 1.43, P = 0.027; on-treatment, 1.27, CL = 1.06, 1.52, P = 0.009; per-protocol, 1.36, CL = 1.13, 1.63, P = 0.001; and g-estimation, 1.31, CL = 1.03,1.72, P = 0.027. Thus g-estimation preserved the ITT test of the null, but exhibited more uncertainty about the size of the tiotropium effect than the other methods. In particular, it allowed for a much larger potential effect than did ITT analysis, but produced a much larger null P than exhibited by per-protocol analysis. LIMITATIONS: Like ITT analysis, g-estimation requires all patients be followed to the end of the trial protocol, regardless of whether they comply with the protocol. Like on-treatment and per-protocol analyses, it also requires accurate compliance information be recorded. CONCLUSION: G-estimation should become a standard procedure for the analysis of trials with noncompliance. Software to do so is available in major packages, and the procedure is easily coded for other packages.},

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia is a common and serious complication of pregnancy that affects both mother and child. Review of previous small trials of antiplatelet therapy, particularly low-dose aspirin, suggested reductions of about three-quarters in the incidence of pre-eclampsia and some avoidance of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), but larger trials have not confirmed these results. In our multicentre study 9364 women were randomly assigned 60 mg aspirin daily or matching placebo. 74% were entered for prophylaxis of pre-eclampsia, 12% for prophylaxis of IUGR, 12% for treatment of pre-eclampsia, and 3% for treatment of IUGR. Overall, the use of aspirin was associated with a reduction of only 12% in the incidence of proteinuric pre-eclampsia, which was not significant. Nor was there any significant effect on the incidence of IUGR or of stillbirth and neonatal death. Aspirin did, however, significantly reduce the likelihood of preterm delivery (19.7% aspirin vs 22.2% control; absolute reduction of 2.5 [SD 0.9] per 100 women treated; 2p = 0.003). There was a significant trend (p = 0.004) towards progressively greater reductions in proteinuric pre-eclampsia the more preterm the delivery. Aspirin was not associated with a significant increase in placental haemorrhages or in bleeding during preparation for epidural anaesthesia, but there was a slight increase in use of blood transfusion after delivery. Low-dose aspirin was generally safe for the fetus and newborn infant, with no evidence of an increased likelihood of bleeding. Our findings do not support routine prophylactic or therapeutic administration of antiplatelet therapy in pregnancy to all women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia or IUGR. Low-dose aspirin may be justified in women judged to be especially liable to early-onset pre-eclampsia severe enough to need very preterm delivery. In such women it seems appropriate to start low-dose aspirin prophylactically early in the second trimester.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay development of pre-eclampsia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents for women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (July 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 1), EMBASE (1994 to November 2005) and handsearched congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-nine trials (37,560 women) are included. There is a 17% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((46 trials, 32,891 women, relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.89), number needed to treat (NNT) 72 (52, 119)). Although there is no statistical difference in RR based on maternal risk, there is a significant increase in the absolute risk reduction of pre-eclampsia for high risk (risk difference (RD) -5.2% (-7.5, -2.9), NNT 19 (13, 34)) compared with moderate risk women (RD -0.84 (-1.37, -0.3), NNT 119 (73, 333)). Antiplatelets were associated with an 8% reduction in the relative risk of preterm birth (29 trials, 31,151 women, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97); NNT 72 (52, 119)), a 14% reduction in fetal or neonatal deaths (40 trials, 33,098 women, RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98); NNT 243 (131, 1,666) and a 10% reduction in small-for-gestational age babies (36 trials, 23,638 women, RR 0.90, 95% CI0.83 to 0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups for any other outcomes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia. SEARCH STRATEGY: This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994-1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked. MAIN RESULTS: Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of asprin or gestation at randomisation. Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0. 75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, >10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.},

@article{James2008,
	abstract = {In the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers hypothesized that aspirin could be used to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. This hypothesis was tested in numerous trials which showed limited, but positive results. Subsequently, aspirin has been used in an attempt to improve pregnancy outcomes in women who have both antiphospholipid antibodies and a history of recurrent loss, and has also been used in an attempt to improve the success of in vitro fertilization. In theory, aspirin has both positive and negative effects on reproduction. Aspirin, which suppresses cyclooxygenase, has the potential to interfere with implantation, but also has the potential to support the maintenance of pregnancy. Aspirin is prescribed with increasing frequency to reduce the risk of maternal thrombosis and reduce the risk of miscarriage and poor pregnancy outcome. Aspirin alone, however, is not considered sufficient to prevent thrombosis and even in women with the antiphospholipid syndrome, the question as to whether low-dose aspirin improves pregnancy outcomes has not been answered affirmatively. Aspirin has potential risks. Aspirin inhibits platelet function and can contribute to maternal and fetal bleeding. Aspirin crosses the placenta. Although aspirin has not been associated with other congenital anomalies, it has been associated with an increased risk of vascular disruptions, particularly gastroschisis and possibly premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Nonetheless, large trials demonstrate low-dose aspirin's relative safety and generally positive effects on reproductive outcomes.},

@article{Vane2003,
	abstract = {The therapy of rheumatism began thousands of years ago with the use of decoctions or extracts of herbs or plants such as willow bark or leaves, most of which turned out to contain salicylates. Following the advent of synthetic salicylate, Felix Hoffman, working at the Bayer company in Germany, made the acetylated form of salicylic acid in 1897. This drug was named "Aspirin" and became the most widely used medicine of all time. In 1971, Vane discovered the mechanism by which aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. He proved that aspirin and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the activity of the enzyme now called cyclooxygenase (COX) which leads to the formation of prostaglandins (PGs) that cause inflammation, swelling, pain and fever. However, by inhibiting this key enzyme in PG synthesis, the aspirin-like drugs also prevented the production of physiologically important PGs which protect the stomach mucosa from damage by hydrochloric acid, maintain kidney function and aggregate platelets when required. This conclusion provided a unifying explanation for the therapeutic actions and shared side effects of the aspirin-like drugs. Twenty years later, with the discovery of a second COX gene, it became clear that there are two isoforms of the COX enzyme. The constitutive isoform, COX-1, supports the beneficial homeostatic functions, whereas the inducible isoform, COX-2, becomes upregulated by inflammatory mediators and its products cause many of the symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.},

	abstract = {In randomized trials comparing a new therapy to standard therapy, the sharp null hypothesis of equivalent therapeutic efficacy does not imply the intent-to-treat null hypothesis of equal outcome distributions in the two-treatment arm if non-compliance is present. As a consequence, the development of analytic methods that adjust for non-compliance is of particular importance in equivalence trials comparing a new therapy to standard therapy. This paper provides, in the context of equivalence trial, a unified overview of various analytic approaches to correct for non-compliance in randomized trials. The overview focuses on comparing and contrasting the plausibility, robustness, and strength of assumptions required by each method and their programming and computational burdens. In addition, several new structural (causal) models are introduced: the coarse structural nested models, the non-nested marginal structural models and the continuous-time structural nested models, and their properties are compared with those of previously proposed structural nested models. The fundamental assumption that allows us to correct for non-compliance is that the decision whether or not to continue to comply with assigned therapy at time t is random (that is, ignorable or explainable) conditional on the history up to t of measured pre- and time-dependent post-randomization prognostic factors. In the final sections of the paper, we consider how the consequences of violations of our assumption of conditionally ignorable non-compliance can be explored through a sensitivity analysis. Finally, the analytic methods described in this paper can also be used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment from observational data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if antimullerian hormone (AMH) is associated with pregnancy loss. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study within a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Women (n = 1,228) were of ages 18-40 years with a history of one to two pregnancy losses and were actively attempting pregnancy without fertility treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy loss. RESULT(S): Relative risks (and 95% confidence interval [CIs]) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-detected and clinical pregnancy loss were assessed with the use of log binomial models with robust variance and inverse probability weights adjusted for age, race, body mass index, income, trial treatment assignment, parity, number of previous losses, and time since most recent loss. AMH levels were defined as: low (<1.00 ng/mL; n = 124), normal (referent; 1.00-3.5 ng/mL; n = 595), and high (>3.5 ng/mL; n = 483). Of the 1,202 women with baseline AMH data, 19 (17.3%) with low AMH experienced a clinical loss, compared with 61 (11.4%) with normal AMH and 50 (11.8%) with high AMH levels. Low or high AMH levels, compared with normal AMH, were not associated with clinical loss. Results for hCG-detected pregnancy loss mirrored those of clinical loss. CONCLUSION(S): AMH values were not associated with hCG-detected or clinical pregnancy loss in unassisted conceptions in women with a history of one to two previous losses. Our data do not support routine AMH testing for prediction of pregnancy loss. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00467363.},

@article{Ahrens2016,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate complications and safety of preconception low-dose aspirin in 1,228 U.S. women (2007-2011). METHODS: Evaluation of the safety of low-dose aspirin in the participants and their fetuses was a planned secondary analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial, a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of low-dose aspirin on the incidence of live birth. Women aged 18-40 years with a history of one to two pregnancy losses trying to conceive were randomized to daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg, n=615) or placebo (n=613) and were followed for up to six menstrual cycles or through gestation if they became pregnant. Emergency care visits and possible aspirin-related symptoms were assessed at each study follow-up using standardized safety interviews. In addition, complications for both the participant and her fetus or neonate were captured prospectively using case report forms, interviews conducted during pregnancy and postpartum, and medical records. RESULTS: The proportion of women with at least one possible aspirin-related symptom during the trial was similar between treatment arms (456 [74%] low-dose aspirin compared with 447 [73%] placebo, P=.65) as was the proportion with at least one emergency care visit (104 [17%] low-dose aspirin compared with 99 [16%] placebo, P=.76). Maternal complications were evenly distributed by treatment arm with the exception of vaginal bleeding, which was more commonly reported in the low-dose aspirin arm (22% compared with 17%, P=.02). The distribution of fetal and neonatal complications-which included three stillbirths, three neonatal deaths, and 10 neonates with birth defect(s)-was similar between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Although rare but serious complications resulting from low-dose aspirin cannot be ruled out, preconception low-dose aspirin appears to be well tolerated by women trying to conceive, women who become pregnant, and by their fetuses and neonates.},

@article{Mumford2016,
	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What is the association between daily preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin (LDA) treatment and very early pregnancy losses or euploid (chromosomally normal) losses among women with one to two prior losses? SUMMARY ANSWER: Daily LDA initiated preconception was not associated with the rate or type of pregnancy loss among women with a history of one to two prior pregnancy losses. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: LDA is often used to treat recurrent pregnancy loss with reductions in pregnancy loss generally only observed among women with antiphospholipid antibodies, and null associations observed among women without antiphospholipid antibodies. We previously evaluated the association between LDA and pregnancy loss overall among women with one to two prior losses in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial and found no association, though did not distinguish between potential effects at different stages of pregnancy loss, including implantation failure, or between euploid and aneuploid losses. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The EAGeR trial was a multi-site prospective block-randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1228 women were randomized to daily LDA (81 mg/day) plus folic acid (400 mcg/day), or placebo plus folic acid. Participants were assigned study drug for less than or equal to six menstrual cycles or if they conceived, throughout pregnancy with study drug discontinued at 36 weeks gestation. This analysis includes additional outcome information obtained from chart abstractions after the completion of the trial, as well as testing of stored urine for measurement of hCG and detection of very early pregnancy losses, and karyotyping of the products of conception for assessment of aneuploidy of the losses. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 18-40 with a history of one to two prior losses and actively trying to conceive were randomized (n = 615 LDA and n = 613 placebo) at four clinical centers in the USA (2007-2011). Log-binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios under the intent-to-treat approach. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Daily LDA initiated preconception was not associated with clinically recognized pregnancy losses or implantation failures among women with proved fecundity and a history of one to two prior losses. Specifically, 1088 (88.6%) women completed the trial with 797 having an hCG detected pregnancy (64.9%). Overall there were 133 clinical losses (12.7% LDA versus 11.8% placebo, P = 0.71) and 55 implantation failures (5.2% LDA versus 4.9% placebo, P = 0.89). No differences were found in rate of euploid losses (RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.26). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Generalizability of these findings is limited to women with a history of one to two prior losses, and may further be limited to women of white race with higher socioeconomic status as given the rigors of the study protocol participants tended to be white and have higher incomes and more education. We were also missing karyotype information on approximately one-third of the clinically recognized pregnancy losses, which may limit our power to detect effects on euploid losses, though detailed sensitivity analysis showed similar results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our data do not support the general use of LDA to decrease pregnancy loss and further demonstrate no increased risk of loss for women on LDA treatment.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare time to pregnancy and live birth among couples with varying intervals of pregnancy loss date to subsequent trying to conceive date. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial, 1,083 women aged 18-40 years with one to two prior early losses and whose last pregnancy outcome was a nonectopic or nonmolar loss were included. Participants were actively followed for up to six menstrual cycles and, for women achieving pregnancy, until pregnancy outcome. We calculated intervals as start of trying to conceive date minus pregnancy loss date. Time to pregnancy was defined as start of trying to conceive until subsequent conception. Discrete Cox models, accounting for left truncation and right censoring, estimated fecundability odds ratios (ORs) adjusting for age, race, body mass index, education, and subfertility. Although intervals were assessed prior to randomization and thus reasoned to have no relation with treatment assignment, additional adjustment for treatment was evaluated given that low-dose aspirin was previously shown to be predictive of time to pregnancy. RESULTS: Couples with a 0-3-month interval (n=765 [76.7%]) compared with a greater than 3-month (n=233 [23.4%]) interval were more likely to achieve live birth (53.2% compared with 36.1%) with a significantly shorter time to pregnancy leading to live birth (median [interquartile range] five cycles [three, eight], adjusted fecundability OR 1.71 [95% confidence interval 1.30-2.25]). Additionally adjusting for low-dose aspirin treatment did not appreciably alter estimates. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the hypothesis that there is no physiologic evidence for delaying pregnancy attempt after an early loss.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effect of preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin (LDA; 81 mg/day) treatment on time to pregnancy in women with a history of pregnancy loss. DESIGN: This was a multicenter, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were block-randomized by center and eligibility stratum. SETTING: The study was conducted at four U.S.A. medical centers (2007-2012). PARTICIPANTS: Participants women aged 18-40 years actively attempting pregnancy, stratified by eligibility criteria: the "original" stratum, women with one loss <20 weeks' gestation during the previous year; and the "expanded" stratum, women with one or two previous losses of any gestational age regardless of time since loss. INTERVENTION: Daily LDA was compared with matching placebo for up to six menstrual cycles of attempting pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to hCG detected pregnancy and clinically confirmed pregnancy, analyzed by intention-to-treat, was measured. RESULTS: Of the 1228 women randomly assigned to LDA (n = 615) or placebo (n = 613), 410 (67%) women receiving LDA achieved pregnancy compared to 382 (63%) receiving placebo, corresponding to a fecundability odds ratio (FOR) of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.33). Among women in the original stratum (n = 541), LDA was associated with increased fecundability compared to placebo (FOR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Preconception-initiated LDA treatment resulted in a nonsignificant increase in fecundability of 14% in women with a history of 1-2 pregnancy losses, and a significant increase of 28% in women with a history of only one pregnancy loss of <20 weeks' gestation in the preceding year.

RESULTS: Preterm birth rates were 4.1% (22/535 low-dose aspirin) and 5.7% (31/543 placebo) (relative risk [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.23); spontaneous preterm birth rates were 1.1% (6/535 low-dose aspirin) and 2.2% (12/543 placebo) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19-1.34); medically indicated preterm birth rates were 2.6% (14/535 low-dose aspirin) and 2.9% (16/543 placebo) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.44-1.80). After restriction to confirmed pregnancies using inverse probability weighting, preterm birth rates were 5.7% and 9.0% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.09) and spontaneous preterm birth rates were 1.4% and 3.2% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17-1.18). In confirmed pregnancies in the original stratum, preterm birth occurred in 3.8% and 9.7% of the low-dose aspirin and placebo groups, respectively (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.94). CONCLUSION: Preconception low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with the overall rate of preterm birth. Although the study was underpowered for this secondary analysis, numeric trends in favor of benefit, particularly in the women with a recent, single early pregnancy loss, warrant further investigation.

@article{Wong2015,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the relationship between a short interpregnancy interval (IPI) following a pregnancy loss and subsequent live birth and pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A secondary analysis of women enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial with a human chorionic gonadotropin-positive pregnancy test and whose last reproductive outcome was a loss were included in this analysis (n = 677). IPI was defined as the time between last pregnancy loss and last menstrual period of the current pregnancy and categorized by 3-month intervals. Pregnancy outcomes include live birth, pregnancy loss, and any pregnancy complications. These were compared between IPI groups using multivariate relative risk estimation by Poisson regression. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar between IPI groups. The mean gestational age of prior pregnancy loss was 8.6 +/- 2.8 weeks. The overall live birth rate was 76.5%, with similar live birth rates between those with IPI </=3 months as compared to IPI >3 months (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.16). Rates were also similar for periimplantation loss (aRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.51-1.80), clinically confirmed loss (aRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-1.10), and any pregnancy complication (aRR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09) for those with IPI </=3 months as compared to IPI >3 months. CONCLUSION: Live birth rates and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, were not associated with a very short IPI after a prior pregnancy loss. The traditional recommendation to wait at least 3 months after a pregnancy loss before attempting a new pregnancy may not be warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recruitment into large, preconception randomised clinical trials (RCT) is challenging. We describe clinic and community-based preconception recruitment strategies for the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial and highlight approaches that were and were not successful. This longitudinal RCT was conducted at four major sites in the US. Eligible women had one to two prior pregnancy losses and were actively trying to become pregnant. METHODS: Provider/clinic and community-based outreach strategies were utilised, and the recruitment rate and costs of methods were assessed. RESULTS: A screening questionnaire was completed by 5485 women; 42.4% (n = 2323) screened were initially eligible, of whom 50.7% (n = 1228) were randomised. Provider/clinic-based recruitment yielded the highest number eligible of those screened (30.1%) and also the most randomised participants overall (40.3%). The next highest yield came from direct mail and brochures/flyers at 13.1% and 12.5% of women randomised, respectively. However, direct mailings cost $720 per participant randomised. Other than word of mouth, provider/clinic-based recruitment was the most cost effective method, costing an average of $60 per randomised participant. Web-based recruitment yielded 4.7% of participants at a cost of $278 per randomised participant. CONCLUSIONS: Provider and clinic-based recruitment was the most effective and cost-efficient method of recruitment in a preconception intervention study of reproduction among women.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin (LDA) has been proposed to improve pregnancy outcomes in couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss. However, results from studies of LDA on pregnancy outcomes have been inconsistent, perhaps because most studies evaluated LDA-initiated post-conception. The purpose of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial was to determine whether preconception-initiated LDA improves livebirth rates in women with one to two prior losses. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, block randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Study participants were recruited using community-based advertisements and physician referral to four university medical centres in the US (2006-12). Eligible women were aged 18-40 years actively trying to conceive, with one to two prior losses. Participants were randomised to receive daily LDA (81 mg/day) or a matching placebo, and all were provided with daily 400-mcg folic acid. Follow-up continued for </=6 menstrual cycles while attempting to conceive. For those who conceived, treatment was continued until 36 weeks gestation. The primary outcome was the cumulative livebirth rate over the trial period. RESULTS: There were 1228 women randomised (615 LDA, 613 placebo). Participants had a mean age of 28.7, were mostly white (95%), well educated (86% more than high school education), and employed (75%) with a household income >$100 000 annually (40%). The characteristics of those in the treatment and placebo arms were well balanced. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the study design, recruitment, data collection, and baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in EAGeR, which aimed to determine the effect of LDA on livebirth and other pregnancy outcomes in these women.},

Here we start by describing a wide variety of examples and then introduce instrumental variable methods for the analysis of such trials. We concentrate mainly on situations in which compliance is all or nothing (either the patient receives the allocated treatment or they do not--in the latter case they may receive no treatment or a treatment other than the one allocated). The main purpose of the review is to illustrate the use of latent class (finite mixture) models, using maximum likelihood, for complier-average causal effect estimation under varying assumptions concerning the mechanism of the missing outcome data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since hypercoagulability might result in recurrent miscarriage, anticoagulant agents could potentially increase the chance of live birth in subsequent pregnancies in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, with or without inherited thrombophilia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant agents, such as aspirin and heparin, in women with a history of at least two unexplained miscarriages with or without inherited thrombophilia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 October 2013) and scanned bibliographies of all located articles for any unidentified articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of anticoagulant treatment on live birth in women with a history of at least two unexplained miscarriages with or without inherited thrombophilia were eligible. Interventions included aspirin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the prevention of miscarriage. One treatment could be compared with another or with no-treatment (or placebo). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (PJ and SK) assessed the studies for inclusion in the review and extracted the data. If necessary they contacted study authors for more information. We double checked the data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies, including data of 1228 women, were included in the review evaluating the effect of either LMWH (enoxaparin or nadroparin in varying doses) or aspirin or a combination of both, on the chance of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage, with or without inherited thrombophilia. Studies were heterogeneous with regard to study design and treatment regimen and three studies were considered to be at high risk of bias. Two of these three studies at high risk of bias showed a benefit of one treatment over the other, but in sensitivity analyses (in which studies at high risk of bias were excluded) anticoagulants did not have a beneficial effect on live birth, regardless of which anticoagulant was evaluated (risk ratio (RR) for live birth in women who received aspirin compared to placebo 0.94, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.11, n = 256), in women who received LMWH compared to aspirin RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.26, n = 239), and in women who received LMWH and aspirin compared to no-treatment RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.16) n = 322).Obstetric complications such as preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and congenital malformations were not significantly affected by any treatment regimen. In included studies, aspirin did not increase the risk of bleeding, but treatment with LWMH and aspirin increased the risk of bleeding significantly in one study. Local skin reactions (pain, itching, swelling) to injection of LMWH were reported in almost 40% of patients in the same study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a limited number of studies on the efficacy and safety of aspirin and heparin in women with a history of at least two unexplained miscarriages with or without inherited thrombophilia. Of the nine reviewed studies quality varied, different treatments were studied and of the studies at low risk of bias only one was placebo-controlled. No beneficial effect of anticoagulants in studies at low risk of bias was found. Therefore, this review does not support the use of anticoagulants in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. The effect of anticoagulants in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage and inherited thrombophilia needs to be assessed in further randomised controlled trials; at present there is no evidence of a beneficial effect.},

The method entails adding additional measurement error in known increments to the data, computing estimates from the contaminated data, establishing a trend between these estimates and the variance of the added errors, and extrapolating this trend back to the case of no measurement error. We show that the method is equivalent or asymptotically equivalent to method-of-moments estimation in linear measurement error modeling. Simulation studies are presented showing that the method produces estimators that are nearly asymptotically unbiased and efficient in standard and nonstandard logistic regression models. An oversimiplified but fairly accurate description of the method is that it is method-of-moments estimation using Monte Carlo-derived estimating equations.},

For both approaches, the popular models are of a proportional hazards type. Such models have been used for studying prognostic factors in acute and chronic leukemias.

That is, understanding the effects of covariates on cause-specific hazards and cumulative incidence functions go hand in hand. A case study illustrates our proposal.},

	abstract = {The assessment of compliance is critical in the evaluation of the effectiveness of a new therapeutic agent. Fifteen patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, many of whom had previously demonstrated erratic compliance with deferoxamine, were enrolled in a clinical trial of a new oral iron chelator, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1). Their compliance with this medication was estimated by several existing methods and the novel Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Overall compliance as assessed by the MEMS was 78.5 +/- 13.0% of prescribed doses taken, significantly lower than the corresponding rates calculated by pill counts and diaries (91.5 +/- 9.2% and 94.1 +/- 4.3%, respectively). However, several serious problems were encountered with the MEMS, mostly in the form of incorrect use of the device by the patients. Disclosure of the nature of the MEMS and the compliance monitoring process did not alter the rate of adherence with L1 therapy. Compliance as determined by pill counts did not differ between the 1st and 2nd 6-month periods. Although not reaching statistical significance, a trend towards better L1 compliance occurred in those patients in whom serum ferritin levels decreased. Patients who filled at least 50% of their diaries had significantly better compliance by pill counts than those who completed less than 50% of their diaries (95.9 +/- 4.1% and 86.5 +/- 11.1%, respectively). Steady-state L1 trough concentrations and 24-hour urinary iron excretion did not correlate with L1 compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal loss, the death of a fetus/child through miscarriage or stillbirth, is associated with significant depression and anxiety, particularly in a subsequent pregnancy. AIMS: This study examined the degree to which symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with a previous loss persisted following a subsequent successful pregnancy. METHOD: Data were derived from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort, a longitudinal cohort study in the west of England that has followed mothers from pregnancy into the postnatal period. A total of 13,133 mothers reported on the number and conditions of previous perinatal losses and provided self-report measures of depression and anxiety at 18 and 32 weeks' gestation and at 8 weeks and 8, 21 and 33 months postnatally. Controls for pregnancy outcome and obstetric and psychosocial factors were included. RESULTS: Generalised estimating equations indicated that the number of previous miscarriages/stillbirths significantly predicted symptoms of depression (beta = 0.18, s.e. = 0.07, P<0.01) and anxiety (beta = 0.14, s.e. = 0.05, P<0.01) in a subsequent pregnancy, independent of key psychosocial and obstetric factors. This association remained constant across the pre- and postnatal period, indicating that the impact of a previous prenatal loss did not diminish significantly following the birth of a healthy child. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety associated with a previous prenatal loss shows a persisting pattern that continues after the birth of a subsequent (healthy) child. Interventions targeting women with previous prenatal loss may improve the health outcomes of women and their children.},

@article{Regan1989,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of spontaneous abortion in a population of women in order to establish their risk of spontaneous abortion and the obstetric factors predisposing to it. DESIGN: Prospective study of women recruited by radio and poster appeal and from hospital outpatient clinics. SETTING: English provincial community. PATIENTS: 630 Women from the general population intending to become pregnant. INTERVENTIONS: The viability of the pregnancy was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography before completion of the eighth week, and the assessment was repeated if vaginal bleeding occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Spontaneous abortion or live births in women with or without a previous history of spontaneous abortion. RESULTS: The overall incidence of clinically recognisable spontaneous abortion before 20 weeks of gestation was 12% (50/407 pregnancies). The risk of spontaneous abortion in each category of patient was classified with respect to the patient's past reproductive performance and found to be influenced greatly by her previous obstetric history. In primigravidas and women with a history of consistently successful pregnancies the incidences of abortion were low (5% (4/87) and 4% (3/73) respectively), whereas women with only unsuccessful histories had a much greater risk of aborting the study pregnancy (24% (24/98)), even when their sole pregnancy had ended in abortion (20% (12/59)). The outcome of the last pregnancy also influenced the outcome of the study pregnancy; only 5% of women (5/95) whose previous pregnancy had been successful aborted, whereas the incidence of loss of pregnancy among women whose last pregnancy had aborted was 19% (40/214). CONCLUSIONS: A knowledge of the patient's reproductive history is essential for the clinical assessment of her risk of spontaneous abortion. As the most important predictive factor for spontaneous abortion is a previous abortion, the outcome of a woman's first pregnancy has profound consequences for all subsequent pregnancies.},

@article{Lok2007,
	abstract = {Emerging evidence has suggested that miscarriage could be associated with significant and possibly enduring psychological consequences. As many as 50% of miscarrying women suffer some form of psychological morbidity in the weeks and months after loss. About 40% of miscarrying women were found to be suffering from symptoms of grief shortly after miscarriage, and pathological grief can follow. Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are common, and major depressive disorder has been reported in 10-50% after miscarriage. Psychological symptoms could persist for 6 months to 1 year after miscarriage. The underlying risk factors predisposing a miscarrying woman to psychological morbidity include a history of psychiatric illness, childlessness, lack of social support or poor marital adjustment, prior pregnancy loss, and ambivalence toward the fetus. In addition, care-givers should be aware of the possible moderating effect of clinical practices such as surgical treatment and ultrasound findings on the psychological impact on a miscarrying woman. Unlike in postpartum depression, simple and effective screening measures of psychological morbidity in the context of miscarriage have not been well established. While studies have highlighted that psychological follow-up was highly desired by miscarrying women, and that psychological intervention was potentially beneficial, there is a substantial lack of randomized controlled intervention studies in this area.},

	abstract = {This review considers the psychological impact of miscarriage and follow-up care. A fifth of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and the experience leads to emotional consequences such as depression and anxiety, which may last for several months. Some have explored the focus of psychological morbidity and attempted to discover predictors of adjustment, but results are inconclusive. Grief has been identified as a feature of postmiscarriage distress, but trauma associated with the process of miscarriage has been neglected. Despite the recognized impact, there is dissatisfaction with professional emotional care, and there is no routine follow-up. There have been no controlled intervention studies with women who miscarry during early pregnancy, although anecdotal evidence suggests beneficial effects. Such studied have concentrated on loss, but perhaps future research should consider the whole experience of miscarriage. An intervention derived from trauma research has been suggested as a possible strategy for facilitating emotional adjustment and preventing longer term negative responses.},

@article{Hansen2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of birth defects in infants born following assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment is a controversial question. Most publications examining the prevalence of birth defects in ICSI and IVF infants compared to spontaneously conceived infants have serious methodological limitations; despite this, most researchers have concluded that there is no increased risk. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review to identify all papers published by March 2003 with data relating to the prevalence of birth defects in infants conceived following IVF and/or ICSI compared with spontaneously conceived infants. Independent expert reviewers used criteria defined a priori to determine whether studies were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Fixed effects meta-analysis was performed for all studies and reviewer-selected studies. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were identified for review. Two-thirds of these showed a 25% or greater increased risk of birth defects in ART infants. The results of meta-analyses of the seven reviewer-selected studies and of all 25 studies suggest a statistically significant 30-40% increased risk of birth defects associated with ART. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled results from all suitable published studies suggest that children born following ART are at increased risk of birth defects compared with spontaneous conceptions. This information should be made available to couples seeking ART treatment.},

@article{Hernan2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The intention-to-treat comparison is the primary, if not the only, analytic approach of many randomized clinical trials. PURPOSE: To review the shortcomings of intention-to-treat analyses, and of 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses as commonly implemented, with an emphasis on problems that are especially relevant for comparative effectiveness research. METHODS AND RESULTS: In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, intention-to-treat analyses underestimate the treatment effect and are therefore nonconservative for both safety trials and noninferiority trials. In randomized clinical trials with an active comparator, intention-to-treat estimates can overestimate a treatment's effect in the presence of differential adherence. In either case, there is no guarantee that an intention-to-treat analysis estimates the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Inverse probability weighting, g-estimation, and instrumental variable estimation can reduce the bias introduced by nonadherence and loss to follow-up in 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses. LIMITATIONS: These analyse require untestable assumptions, a dose-response model, and time-varying data on confounders and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that all randomized clinical trials with substantial lack of adherence or loss to follow-up are analyzed using different methods. These include an intention-to-treat analysis to estimate the effect of assigned treatment and 'as treated' and 'per protocol' analyses to estimate the effect of treatment after appropriate adjustment via inverse probability weighting or g-estimation.},

One approach uses either screening or diagnosis of embryonic chromosomes prior to embryo replacement {$[$}preimplantation genetic screening (PGS)/preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD){$]$}. The second approach involves surrogacy. However, PGS/PGD assumes that the embryo is chromosomally abnormal, and that the mother should receive a chromosomally normal embryo. Surrogacy assumes that the embryo is normal and that the maternal environment needs to be substituted. This article examines the place of both techniques in different types of recurrent miscarriage, and tries to give guidelines as to which technique is preferable depending on the likelihood of an embryonic chromosome aberration. In repeated fetal aneuploidy or in the older patient, PGS or PGD are preferable. However, with high numbers of miscarriages, or in autoimmune pregnancy loss, surrogacy is preferable. In the light of recent work, it is uncertain which treatment mode is indicated in balanced parental chromosome aberrations. In conclusion, both techniques have a place, but probably only in those patients with a poor prognosis in whom assisted reproductive techniques will be shown to improve the subsequent live birth rate above the spontaneous rate.},

	abstract = {Knowing the frequency and timing of pregnancy loss during normal gestation is integral to evaluating the safety of prenatal diagnostic techniques. That preclinical loss rates are high in humans has long been suspected, but in the past decade new data concerning these losses have become available. Cohort studies indicate that many women who show positive beta-HCG assays never show clinical evidence of pregnancy. Cytogenetic abnormalities have also recently been documented in 20% of ostensibly normal in vitro fertilization embryos. All the above are consistent with the sentinel studies of Hertig and Rock, who showed high frequencies of morphological abnormalities in preimplantation embryos. The frequency of fetal losses after clinical recognition of pregnancy is 12-15%; however, more sensitive (ultrasonographic) methods of detecting fetal demise now indicate that most clinically recognized pregnancies occur prior to 8-9 weeks, being retained in utero 2-3 weeks prior to expulsion. Loss rates are influenced by maternal age, smoking, alcohol, and other confounding variables that if not taken into account could yield spurious results concerning safety of prenatal diagnostic techniques. After 8 weeks gestation the likelihood of losing a viable pregnancy is only 3% and after 16 weeks only 1%.},

	abstract = {Miscarriage is a very common occurrence in humans. This paper sets out to present published data on research that has provided increased understanding of pregnancy failure. Clarification of definitions, exploring the range of failures from preclinical to later pregnancy losses, and the scientific tools employed to find information on the losses have been documented. What is now understood, which tools work best, and the associated limitations are all discussed. Early studies used cytogenetic methods and tissue culture to obtain results. Improvements in laboratory tools such as better tissue culture incubators, inverted microscopes, laminar flow hoods, improvements in culture media, all contributed to obtaining more results for patients. These studies demonstrated the significant contribution of unbalanced chromosomal karyotypes to pregnancy failure. Maternal age as a contributing factor in trisomy was clearly demonstrated. First trimester miscarriage exhibits very high cytogenetic abnormality; in contrast to very low rates in later losses. Combining data across all time periods of pregnancy will affect the significance of chromosomal error in the early pregnancy failures. Cytogenetic methods investigate whole genomes, and are considered to represent the standard against which new methods must be validated. New molecular genetic methods provide the opportunity to examine samples without the necessity of tissue culture. Techniques may be site-specific or whole genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), array-based CGH, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR), have all been utilised. In comparison studies with classical/conventional cytogenetics, each newer method offers advantages and limitations. At the present time, a combined approach using conventional and molecular methods will elucidate the cause of miscarriage for almost all samples. In a clinical setting this would be optimum.},

	url = {http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/10/2243.abstract N2 - Infertility care has improved remarkably over the last few decades and has received growing attention from health care providers. Several treatments, including expensive options such as Assisted Reproductive Techniques, are now widely available for routine clinical use. In most cases, adoption of these treatments has occurred without robust cost-effective analyses. IVF for unexplained infertility and ICSI in the absence of semen abnormalities are two examples of this gradual technology creep. More in-depth economic analyses in the field of infertility are undoubtedly warranted. However, performing these analyses is challenging because infertility care poses a number of unique challenges. Studies of cost-effectiveness are open to criticism because there is a lack of consensus about the outcomes of choice and the appropriate perspective. The use of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) to allow comparisons with other clinical conditions is also controversial because the value associated with infertility care cannot be easily captured in QALYs. Moreover, their use triggers the crucial question of whose QALYs merit consideration—an individual's, a couple's or a child's. In conclusion, economic analysis in infertility represents a peculiar but crucial challenge. If management of infertility is to become an integral part of publicly or privately funded health care systems worldwide, better quality data and a shared vision about the costs and benefits of infertility treatments are needed.},

@article{Shrier2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most methodologists recommend intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis in order to minimize bias. Although ITT analysis provides an unbiased estimate for the effect of treatment assignment on the outcome, the estimate is biased for the actual effect of receiving treatment (active treatment) compared to some comparison group (control). Other common analyses include measuring effects in (1) participants who follow their assigned treatment (Per Protocol), (2) participants according to treatment received (As Treated), and (3) those who would comply with recommended treatment (Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) as estimated by Principal Stratification or Instrumental Variable Analyses). As each of these analyses compares different study subpopulations, they address different research questions. PURPOSE: For each type of analysis, we review and explain (1) the terminology being used, (2) the main underlying concepts, (3) the questions that are answered and whether the method provides valid causal estimates, and (4) the situations when the analysis should be conducted. METHODS: We first review the major concepts in relation to four nuances of the clinical question, 'Does treatment improve health?' After reviewing these concepts, we compare the results of the different analyses using data from two published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Each analysis has particular underlying assumptions and all require dichotomizing adherence into Yes or No. We apply sensitivity analyses so that intermediate adherence is considered (1) as adherence and (2) as non-adherence. RESULTS: The ITT approach provides an unbiased estimate for how active treatment will improve (1) health in the population if a policy or program is enacted or (2) health of patients if a clinician changes treatment practice. The CACE approach generally provides an unbiased estimate of the effect of active treatment on health of patients who would follow the clinician's advice to take active treatment. Unfortunately, there is no current analysis for clinicians and patients who want to know whether active treatment will improve the patient's health if taken, which is different from the effect in patients who would follow the clinician's advice to take active treatment. Sensitivity analysis for the CACE using two published data sets suggests that the underlying assumptions appeared to be violated. LIMITATIONS: There are several methods within each analytical approach we describe. Our analyses are based on a subset of these approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Although adherence-based analyses may provide meaningful information, the analytical method should match the clinical question, and investigators should clearly outline why they believe assumptions hold and should provide empirical tests of the assumptions where possible.},

@article{Dekel2014,
	abstract = {Approximately half of all human embryo implantations result in failed pregnancy. Multiple factors may contribute to this failure, including genetic or metabolic abnormalities of the embryo. However, many of these spontaneous early abortion cases are attributed to poor uterine receptivity. Furthermore, although many fertility disorders have been overcome by a variety of assisted reproductive techniques, implantation remains the rate-limiting step for the success of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. We, as well as others, have demonstrated that endometrial biopsies performed either during the spontaneous, preceding cycle, or during the IVF cycle itself, significantly improve the rate of implantation, clinical pregnancies, and live births. These observations suggest that mechanical injury of the endometrium may enhance uterine receptivity by provoking the immune system to generate an inflammatory reaction. In strong support of this idea, we recently found that dendritic cells (DCs), an important cellular component of the innate immune system, play a critical role in successful implantation in a mouse model. In this review, we discuss the hypothesis that the injury-derived inflammation in the biopsy-treated patients generates a focus for uterine DCs and Mac accumulation that, in turn, enhance the endometrial expression of essential molecules that facilitate the interaction between the embryo and the uterine epithelium.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin might positively affect pregnancy outcomes, but this possibility has not been adequately assessed. Our aim was to investigate whether low-dose aspirin improved livebirth rates in women with one to two previous pregnancy losses. METHODS: In this multicentre, block-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, women aged 18-40 years who were attempting to become pregnant were recruited from four medical centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by eligibility criteria--the original stratum was restricted to women with one loss at less than 20 weeks' gestation during the previous year, whereas the expanded stratum included women with one to two previous losses, with no restrictions on gestational age or time of loss. Women were block-randomised by centre and eligibility stratum in a 1:1 ratio. Preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin (81 mg per day) plus folic acid was compared with placebo plus folic acid for up to six menstrual cycles; for women who conceived, study treatment continued until 36 weeks' gestation. Participants, trial staff, and investigators were masked to the assigned treatment. The primary outcome was livebirth rate, which was analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00467363. FINDINGS: Overall, 1228 women were recruited and randomly assigned between June 15, 2007, and July 15, 2011, 1078 of whom completed the trial and were included in the analysis (535 in the low-dose aspirin group and 543 in the placebo group). 309 (58%) women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths, compared with 286 (53%) in the placebo group (p=0.0984; absolute difference in livebirth rate 5.09% [95% CI -0.84 to 11.02]). Pregnancy loss occurred in 68 (13%) women in the low-dose aspirin group, compared with 65 (12%) women in the placebo group (p=0.7812). In the original stratum, 151 (62%) of 242 women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths, compared with 133 (53%) of 250 in the placebo group (p=0.0446; absolute difference in livebirth rate 9.20% [0.51 to 17.89]). In the expanded stratum, 158 (54%) of 293 women in the low-dose aspirin group and 153 (52%) of 293 in the placebo group had livebirths (p=0.7406; absolute difference in livebirth rate 1.71% [-6.37 to 9.79]). Major adverse events were similar between treatment groups. Low-dose aspirin was associated with increased vaginal bleeding, but this adverse event was not associated with pregnancy loss. INTERPRETATION: Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with livebirth or pregnancy loss in women with one to two previous losses. However, higher livebirth rates were seen in women with a single documented loss at less than 20 weeks' gestation during the previous year. Low-dose aspirin is not recommended for the prevention of pregnancy loss.

Both model- and method-of-moment based IV estimators are considered. The assumptions underlying these estimators are assessed, standard errors and mean squared errors of the estimates are compared, and design implications of the three methods are examined. Extensions of the methods to include observed covariates are then discussed, emphasizing the role of compliance propensity methods and the contrasting role of covariates in these extensions.

	abstract = {The infant mortality rate (IMR) of 6.0 per 1000 live births in the United States in 2013 is nearly the highest among developed countries. Moreover, the IMR among blacks is >twice that among whites-11.11 versus 5.06 deaths per 1000 live births.This higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR is due to a higher preterm birth rate (11.4% of live births in 2013) and higher IMR among term infants. The United States also ranks near the bottom for maternal mortality and life expectancy among the developed nations-despite ranking highest in the proportion of gross national product spent on health care. This suggests that factors other than health care contribute to the higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR. One factor is disadvantaged socioeconomic status. All of the actionable determinates that negatively impact health-personal behavior, social factors, heath-care access and quality and the environment-disproportionately affect the poor. Addressing disadvantaged socioeconomic status by improving access to quality health care and increasing social expenditures would have the greatest impact on the USA's IMR and racial disparity in IMR.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 21 April 2016; doi:10.1038/jp.2016.63.},

Formulae for such priors have been derived for generalized linear models, but their accuracy depends on two approximation steps. This note presents a method for using offsets as well as scaling factors to improve the accuracy of the approximations in logistic regression. This method produces an exceptionally simple form of data augmentation that allows it to be used with any standard package for conditional-logistic or proportional-hazards regression to perform Bayesian and semi-Bayes analyses of matched and survival data. The method is illustrated with an analysis of a matched case-control study of diet and breast cancer.},

@article{Manski1993a,
	abstract = {The aim of methodological research in the social sciences is to learn what conclusions can and cannot be drawn given empirically relevant combinations of assumptions and data. Methodologists have long found it useful to separate inferential problems into statistical and identification components. Studies of identification seek to characterize the conclusions that could be drawn if the researcher had available a sample of unlimited size. Studies of statistical inference seek to characterize the generally weaker conclusions that can be drawn given a sample of positive but finite size. Statistical and identification problems limit in distinct ways the conclusions that may be drawn in empirical research. Statistical problems are most severe when the available sample is small. Identification problems are most severe when the researcher knows little about the population under study and the sampling process yields only weak data on the population. This chapter synthesizes some of my recent research and thinking on identification problems in the social sciences. Four problems are discussed: extrapolation of regressions, the selection problem, identification of endogenous social effects, and identification of subjective phenomena. These problems arise regularly in social science research and are the source of many substantive disputes.},

@article{Li2015,
	abstract = {Instrumental variable (IV) methods are popular in non-experimental studies to estimate the causal effects of medical interventions. These approaches allow for the consistent estimation of treatment effects even if important confounding factors are unobserved. Despite the increasing use of these methods, there have been few extensions of IV methods to censored data problems. In this article, we discuss challenges in applying IV techniques to the proportional hazards model and demonstrate the utility of the additive hazards formulation for IV analyses with censored data. Assuming linear structural equation models for the hazard function, we develop a closed-form, two-stage estimator for the causal effect in the additive hazard model. The methods permit both continuous and discrete exposures, and enable the estimation of causal relative survival measures. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are derived and the resulting inferences are shown to perform well in simulation studies and in an application to a data set on the effectiveness of a novel chemotherapeutic agent for colon cancer.},

Special attention is given to the task of model selection, which involves selection of the model form, selection of the variables to enter the model, and selection of the form of these variables in the model. Several conclusions are drawn, among them: a) model and variable forms should be selected based on regression diagnostic procedures, in addition to goodness-of-fit tests; b) variable-selection algorithms in current packaged programs, such as conventional stepwise regression, can easily lead to invalid estimates and tests of effect; and c) variable selection is better approached by direct estimation of the degree of confounding produced by each variable than by significance-testing algorithms. As a general rule, before using a model to estimate effects, one should evaluate the assumptions implied by the model against both the data and prior information.},

	abstract = {Abstract Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites accumulate in adipose tissue through dietary exposure, and have been proposed to contribute to the development of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Toxicity may also result when DDT and its metabolites are released from adipose tissue into the bloodstream as a result of rapid weight loss. We hypothesized that DDT-exposed rats fed a high fat diet (HFD) followed by 60% calorie restriction would have an adverse metabolic response to rapid weight loss. To test this, we exposed obese Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to DDT and a HFD over one month followed by 60% calorie restricted diet for two weeks, and examined metabolic parameters throughout the study. During the HFD feeding period, DDT-exposed rats had significantly elevated postprandial non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and decreased body temperature compared with control rats. During calorie restriction, DDT-exposed rats had lowered food efficiency (weight gained/calories consumed), body temperature, and circulating TSH. Our findings suggest that exposure to DDT may impairs metabolic substrate utilization in rats during dynamic periods of weight gain and weight loss.},

IUGR infants also appear to be at great risk for complications of prematurity, including chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. Childhood implications for IUGR include an increased risk for short stature, cognitive delays with decreased academic achievement, and a small but significant increased risk of neurologic disorders, including cerebral palsy. Low socioeconomic status is correlated with the occurrence of IUGR and is significantly related to long-term disabilities. Morbidities associated with preterm delivery appear to be additive to those associated with fetal growth restriction so IUGR, preterm infants may be at great risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome.},

Effectively, BART is a nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide an updated US birth weight for gestational age reference corrected for likely errors in last menstrual period (LMP)-based gestational age dating, as well as means and SDs, to enable calculation of continuous and categorical measures of birth weight for gestational age. METHODS: From the 2009-2010 US live birth files, we abstracted singleton births between 22 and 44 weeks of gestation with at least 1 nonmissing estimate of gestational age (ie, LMP or obstetric/clinical) and birth weight. Using an algorithm based on birth weight and the concordance between these gestational age estimates, implausible LMP-based gestational age estimates were either excluded or corrected by using the obstetric/clinical estimate. Gestational age- and sex-specific birth weight means, SDs, and smoothed percentiles (3rd, 5th, 10th, 90th, 95th, 97th) were calculated, and the 10th and 90th percentiles were compared with published population-based references. RESULTS: A total of 7 818 201 (99% of eligible) births were included. The LMP-based estimate of gestational age comprised 85% of the dataset, and the obstetric/clinical estimate comprised the remaining 15%. Cut points derived from the current reference identified approximately 10% of births as </=10th and >/=90th percentiles at all gestational weeks, whereas cut points derived from previous US-based references captured variable proportions of infants at these thresholds within the preterm and postterm gestational age ranges. CONCLUSIONS: This updated US-based birth weight for gestational age reference corrects for likely errors in gestational age dating and allows for the calculation of categorical and continuous measures of birth size.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a current national fetal growth curve that can be used as a common reference point by researchers to facilitate investigations of the predictors and consequences of small and large for gestational age delivery. METHODS: Single live births to United States resident mothers in 1991 (n = 3,134,879) were used for the development of this curve, which was compared with four previously published fetal growth curves. Techniques were developed to address cases with implausible birth weight-gestational age combinations and to smooth fetal growth curves across gestational age categories. RESULTS: In general, the previously published fetal growth curves underestimated the 1991 United States reference curve. This underestimation is most apparent during the latter weeks of gestation, approximately 33-38 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the prevalence of fetal growth restriction (FGR) will vary markedly, depending on the fetal growth curve used. Furthermore, many previously published fetal growth curves no longer provide an up-to-date reference for describing the distribution of birth weight by gestational age and for determining FGR that is consistent with the most recent live birth data for the entire United States.},

	abstract = {We hypothesized that normal fetal size would be most appropriately characterized by a hybrid cross-sectional growth chart combining preterm (< 37 weeks) ultrasound-estimated fetal weights and full-term (> or = 37 weeks) birthweights. Concurrent cross-sectional charts defining fetal size were constructed from 1,331 ultrasound-estimated fetal weights (US) (24-40 weeks) and 9,553 birthweights (BW) (24-43 weeks) from a population of singleton offspring without anomalies. Percentile ranks (10th-90th) were established for both charts. Best-fit third-order equations generated by least-squares regression analysis were compared between the two growth charts. Weight distributions (percentile ranks) were compared separately across gestational age, and for preterm and term gestation. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square analysis where appropriate with P < .05 accepted for significance. The BW standard failed to appropriately characterize ultrasound-estimated fetal weight across gestational age. (US: < 10th%, n = 42 [3.1%]; 10-90th%, n = 978 [73.5%]; > 90th%, n = 311 [23.4%], P < .001). The characterization of both preterm and term weights was significantly different between fetal size curves. The birthweight growth curve limited the designation of fetal growth restriction (< 10th%) in the preterm ultrasound group to 1.6% of subjects examined (n = 17, P < .001). In contrast, at term the ultrasound estimation of normal fetal weight (between the 10th and 90th percentiles) included 84% of the term birthweights (P < .05). Cross-sectional sonographically defined fetal size curves provide optimal characterization of preterm fetal weight as estimated by ultrasound. In term gestation, a normative size chart derived from ultrasound estimated fetal weight appears to broaden or overrepresent the tails of the distribution. Hybrid size curves, combining preterm ultrasound estimated fetal weight and term birthweight, provide the best estimate of the normal range of fetal weight across gestational age.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare three different methods for modeling fetal weight gain during the third trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: Ultrasound and live birth weight data were used to construct three models for defining fetal growth during the third trimester: longitudinal ultrasound estimates of fetal weight obtained serially at 3-4 week intervals in 50 uncomplicated, well-dated pregnancies between 19 and 40 weeks' gestation; cross-sectional ultrasound estimates of fetal weight obtained from 2018 ultrasound examinations of singleton, non-anomalous fetuses between 24 and 39 weeks' gestation; and cross-sectional birth weight data obtained from 9553 live singleton, non-anomalous neonates between 24 and 43 completed weeks. Analysis was performed by pairwise partial f test to compare regression curves and zeta test for comparison of mean weekly weight gain. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted for significance. RESULTS: Derived regression lines depicting fetal size across gestation were significantly different from each other (f tests, p < 0.05). Estimates of mean fetal weight were significantly different between the three different models at specific gestational ages. Significant weekly variations in fetal weight gain were observed within the raw cross-sectional data sets, both for ultrasound-estimated fetal weight (range 91-278 g/week) and birth weight (65-309 g/week). CONCLUSIONS: Each of the methods used to model normal fetal weight gain in the third trimester defined a distinct pattern of fetal growth. Normal fetal growth, defined longitudinally, was most closely matched by a combination of cross-sectional ultrasound-derived estimated fetal weight in preterm gestation below 34 weeks' gestation and live birth weight at or beyond 34 weeks.},

@article{Johnsen2006,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims of the present study were to establish reference ranges for the growth of estimated fetal weight (EFW) between gestational weeks 20 and 42 and to determine the effect of fetal and maternal factors. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study was based on 634 low-risk pregnancies and a total of 1799 examinations. Gestational age was computed from last menstrual period. Head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length were measured using ultrasound, and EFW was calculated using the formula of Combs et al. The statistical analysis was based on regression analysis and multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Intrauterine growth expressed by EFW showed a continuous pattern until term. Males were calculated to be 5% heavier than female fetuses at 20 gestational weeks and 3% at 40 weeks. Otherwise, the fetal and maternal effects on intrauterine growth correspond to a weight shift of 1.3% for breech/nonbreech, 2.5% for each increase in maternal height tertile, and -4% for smoking/nonsmoking. Maternal age higher than 34 years had a significant increased EFW of 4.5% compared with maternal age less than 24 years. Cephalic index in the third tertile had a 1.1% lower EFW compared with the first tertile. Maternal weight, body mass index, and parity did not influence the EFW. Terms for customization to individualize the growth patterns are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The present growth chart is recommended as robust reference ranges for assessing EFW and growth. Fetal and maternal variables can be added into the models to individualize the prediction of EFW.},

METHODS: A fetal growth standard was calculated from published birth weight data, sonographic weight standards, and one MRI study. The birth weights from the East Midlands Obstetric Database were modified by an incremental function to compensate for the lower weights of preterm infants. Published sonographic and MRI standards, and the modified birth weight curve were transformed to yield fractional growth curves that express fetal size as a proportion of the expected term weight. These three curves were then averaged, and the standard deviation was taken as 12% of the median. Curves for Europeans and Chinese were then generated. RESULTS: The average curve for fetal weight is a virtually linear function of gestational age, with a weekly weight gain of 5.2% of the expected term birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-derived fetal growth curves are subject to bias inherent in weight estimation formulae. A standard derived from multiple modalities is likely to be a more robust estimate of normal fetal growth.},

In this article we show that correct bootstrap estimates can be obtained by imitating the process of imputing the original data set in the bootstrap resampling; that is, by imputing the bootstrap data sets in exactly the same way that the original data set is imputed. The proposed bootstrap is asymptotically valid irrespective of the sampling design, the imputation method, or the type of statistic used in inference. This enables us to use a unified method in a variety of problems, and in fact this is the only method that works without any restriction on the sampling design, the imputation method, or the type of statistic.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly used to estimate the effect of a treatment or exposure on an outcome in non-randomised studies. We focus on one such method, stratification on the propensity score, comparing it with the method of inverse-probability weighting by the propensity score. The propensity score--the conditional probability of receiving the treatment given observed covariates--is usually an unknown probability estimated from the data. Estimators for the variance of treatment effect estimates typically used in practice, however, do not take into account that the propensity score itself has been estimated from the data. By deriving the asymptotic marginal variance of the stratified estimate of treatment effect, correctly taking into account the estimation of the propensity score, we show that routinely used variance estimators are likely to produce confidence intervals that are too conservative when the propensity score model includes variables that predict (cause) the outcome, but only weakly predict the treatment. In contrast, a comparison with the analogous marginal variance for the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator shows that routinely used variance estimators for the IPW estimator are likely to produce confidence intervals that are almost always too conservative. Because exact calculation of the asymptotic marginal variance is likely to be complex, particularly for the stratified estimator, we suggest that bootstrap estimates of variance should be used in practice.},

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which expectant fathers (n = 59) were assigned randomly to attend either a 2-hour intervention class on infant care and breastfeeding promotion (intervention) or a class on infant care only (control group). The classes, which were led by a peer-educator, were interactive and informal and utilized different media to create an accessible environment for participants. Couples were recruited during the second trimester from a university obstetrics practice. RESULTS: Overall, breastfeeding was initiated by 74% of women whose partners attended the intervention class, as compared with 41% of women whose partners attended the control class (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Expectant fathers can be influential advocates for breastfeeding, playing a critical role in encouraging a woman to breastfeed her newborn infant.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. METHODS: A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. CONCLUSION: Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost.

@article{Kistin1990,
	abstract = {Many factors are associated with low breast-feeding rates among black low-income women. This study examines whether, despite such factors, health professionals' prenatal education of black poor women is associated with increased breast-feeding rates. Black women born in the United States who attended a midwives prenatal clinic (N = 159) were randomly assigned to two types of prenatal education or were followed up in a control group. All women were interviewed on entry into the study and after delivery of their infants. Women assigned to group classes attended at least one session discussing myths, problems, and benefits of breast-feeding. Women assigned to individual prenatal counseling spoke with a pediatrician or nurse practitioner, who discussed breast-feeding topics similar to those covered in the classes. Women in the control group received no additional prenatal education. The three study groups had significantly different percentages of women who breast-fed (controls 22%, classes 46%, individual sessions 53%). Higher percentages of women in the study groups carried out their prenatal plans to breast-feed (controls 50%, classes 86%, individual sessions 62%) or breast-fed despite prenatal plans to bottle-feed (controls 10%, classes 26%, individual sessions 48%). After multivariable analysis controlling for age, prenatal plans to breast-feed, prior breast-feeding experience, perceived support for breast-feeding, education, gravidity, and employment plans, women in intervention groups had a higher likelihood of breast-feeding than control subjects. These findings suggest that an increase in relatively simple, not-too-time-consuming educational efforts in institutions and offices serving black low-income women might yield significant narrowing of the gap in breast-feeding rates between white affluent women and black low-income women.},

@article{Ip2007,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the evidence on the effects of breastfeeding on short- and long-term infant and maternal health outcomes in developed countries. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE(R), CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library in November of 2005. Supplemental searches on selected outcomes were searched through May of 2006. We also identified additional studies in bibliographies of selected reviews and by suggestions from technical experts. REVIEW METHODS: We included systematic reviews/meta-analyses, randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, prospective cohort, and case-control studies on the effects of breastfeeding and relevant outcomes published in the English language. Included studies must have a comparative arm of formula feeding or different durations of breastfeeding. Only studies conducted in developed countries were included in the updates of previous systematic reviews. The studies were graded for methodological quality. RESULTS: We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Forty-three primary studies on infant health outcomes, 43 primary studies on maternal health outcomes, and 29 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that covered approximately 400 individual studies were included in this review. We found that a history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, non-specific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. The relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases was unclear. Similarly, it was also unclear concerning the relationship between breastfeeding and infant mortality in developed countries. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or not breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-pre-pregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear. CONCLUSIONS: A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers from developed countries. Because almost all the data in this review were gathered from observational studies, one should not infer causality based on these findings. Also, there is a wide range of quality of the body of evidence across different health outcomes. For future studies, clear subject selection criteria and definition of "exclusive breastfeeding," reliable collection of feeding data, controlling for important confounders including child-specific factors, and blinded assessment of the outcome measures will help. Sibling analysis provides a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes. In addition, cluster randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of various breastfeeding promotion interventions will provide further opportunity to investigate any disparity in health outcomes as a result of the intervention.},

@article{Hauck2011a,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Benefits of breastfeeding include lower risk of postneonatal mortality. However, it is unclear whether breastfeeding specifically lowers sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) risk, because study results have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis to measure the association between breastfeeding and SIDS. METHODS: We identified 288 studies with data on breastfeeding and SIDS through a Medline search (1966-2009), review articles, and meta-analyses. Twenty-four original case-control studies were identified that provided data on the relationship between breastfeeding and SIDS risk. Two teams of 2 reviewers evaluated study quality according to preset criteria; 6 studies were excluded, which resulted in 18 studies for analysis. Univariable and multivariable odds ratios were extracted. A summary odds ratio (SOR) was calculated for the odds ratios by using the fixed-effect and random-effect inverse-variance methods of meta-analysis. The Breslow-Day test for heterogeneity was performed. RESULTS: For infants who received any amount of breast milk for any duration, the univariable SOR was 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.44), and the multivariable SOR was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.44-0.69). For any breastfeeding at 2 months of age or older, the univariable SOR was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.27-0.54). The univariable SOR for exclusive breastfeeding of any duration was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.24-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding is protective against SIDS, and this effect is stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. The recommendation to breastfeed infants should be included with other SIDS risk-reduction messages to both reduce the risk of SIDS and promote breastfeeding for its many other infant and maternal health benefits.},

@article{Gouveri2011,
	abstract = {The present review outlines the role of breastfeeding in diabetes. In the mother, breastfeeding has been suggested to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, it appears to reduce the risk of premenopausal breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In the neonate and infant, among other benefits, lactation confers protection from future both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Whether lactation protects women with gestational diabetes mellitus and their offspring from future T2DM remains to be answered. Importantly, for diabetic mothers, antidiabetic treatment itself may affect breastfeeding. There is not enough data to allow the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Therefore, insulin currently remains the optimal antidiabetic treatment during lactation. In conclusion, breastfeeding could be considered a modifiable risk factor for the development of diabetes and even a potential protective lifestyle measure from future cardio-metabolic and malignant diseases. Therefore, health care professionals should encourage both women with and without diabetes to breastfeed their children.},

@article{Bonuck2005,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an individualized, prenatal and postnatal, lactation consultant intervention resulted in increased cumulative intensity of breastfeeding up to 52 weeks. DESIGN: The randomized, nonblinded, controlled trial recruited women from prenatal care. Baseline prenatal interviews covered demographic data and breastfeeding experience, intention, and knowledge. Interviews at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after birth collected data on weekly feeding patterns, infant illness, and infant health care use. SETTING: Two community health centers serving low-income, primarily Hispanic and/or black women. PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample included 304 women (intervention: n = 145; control: n = 159) with > or = 1 postnatal interview. INTERVENTION: Study lactation consultants attempted 2 prenatal meetings, a postpartum hospital visit, and/or home visits and telephone calls. Control subjects received the standard of care. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative breastfeeding intensity at 13 and 52 weeks, based on self-reports of weekly feeding, on a 7-level scale. RESULTS: The intervention group was more likely to breastfeed through week 20 (53.0% vs 39.3%). Exclusive breastfeeding rates were low and did not differ according to group. In multivariate analyses, control subjects had lower breastfeeding intensity at 13 weeks (odds ratio [OR]: 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.20) and 52 weeks (OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.48-4.21). US-born control subjects had lowest breastfeeding intensity at 13 weeks (OR: 5.22; 95% CI: 2.43-11.22) and 52 weeks (OR: 5.25; 95% CI: 2.44-11.29). There were no significant differences in breastfeeding intensity among the US-born intervention, foreign-born intervention, and foreign-born control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This "best-practices" intervention was effective in increasing breastfeeding duration and intensity. Breastfeeding promotion should focus on US-born women and exclusive breastfeeding.},

@article{Islami2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is inversely associated with overall risk of breast cancer. This association may differ in breast cancer subtypes defined by receptor status, as they may reflect different mechanisms of carcinogenesis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and prospective cohort studies to investigate the association between breastfeeding and breast cancer by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. DESIGN: We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases and bibliographies of pertinent articles to identify relevant articles and used random-effects models to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: This meta-analysis represents 27 distinct studies (8 cohort and 19 case-control), with a total of 36 881 breast cancer cases. Among parous women, the risk estimates for the association between ever (versus never) breastfeeding and the breast cancers negative for both ER and PR were similar in three cohort and three case-control studies when results were adjusted for several factors, including the number of full-term pregnancies (combined OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82-0.99), with little heterogeneity and no indication of publication bias. In a subset of three adjusted studies that included ER, PR, and HER2 status, ever breastfeeding showed a stronger inverse association with triple-negative breast cancer (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66-0.91) among parous women. Overall, cohort studies showed no significant association between breastfeeding and ER+/PR+ or ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancers, although one and two studies (out of four and seven studies, respectively) showed an inverse association. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed a protective effect of ever breastfeeding against hormone receptor-negative breast cancers, which are more common in younger women and generally have a poorer prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer. The association between breastfeeding and receptor-positive breast cancers needs more investigation.},

	abstract = {The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes breastfeeding and human milk as the "normative standards for infant feeding." Given the documented health benefits, the Academy recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding for at least 12 months as complementary foods are introduced. To better understand trends during 2000-2008 and differences in breastfeeding initiation and duration overall and among black, white, and Hispanic infants born in 2000 and 2008, CDC analyzed National Immunization Survey (NIS) data. Among infants born in 2000, 70.3% had ever breastfed (had breastfeeding initiated), 34.5% breastfed for 6 months, and 16.0% breastfed for 12 months. Among infants born in 2008, the comparable percentages had increased to 74.6%, 44.4%, and 23.4%, respectively. By race/ethnicity, prevalence of breastfeeding initiation in 2000 was 47.4% among blacks, 71.8% among whites, and 77.6% among Hispanics. By 2008, the percentage of infants who ever breastfed had increased among blacks to 58.9% and among whites to 75.2%; an 80.0% prevalence among Hispanics did not amount to a statistically significant increase. From 2000 to 2008, breastfeeding at 6 and 12 months increased significantly among all three racial/ethnic populations. Although the gap between black and white breastfeeding initiation narrowed, black infants still had the lowest prevalences of breastfeeding initiation and duration, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in this population to promote and support breastfeeding. Despite increases in the prevalence of breastfeeding, fewer than half of the infants in the survey were still breastfeeding at 6 months, indicating that women who choose to breastfeed their infants need support to continue breastfeeding.},

	abstract = {Maternal milk has been recommended as the optimal and exclusive source of early nutrition for all infants following birth ad until at least six months of age. Maternal milk is the ideal source of early infant feeding as a result of potent immune factors and a unique composition of nutrients that evolve in tandem with the growth and developmental needs of the infant. Breast milk promotes sensory and cognitive development, and protects the infant against infectious and chronic diseases. Exclusive breast feeding reduces infant mortality due to common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea or pneumonia, and improves recovery times during illness. Breast feeding provides numerous short and long term health benefits for both baby and mother. Beyond the immediate benefits for children, breast feeding contributes to a lifetime of good health. In this review we describe the influence of breast feeding on mental and psychomotor development, on the risk of endocrinological disorders, pediatric cancers and allergic diseases for the breastfed child. More prospective studies with comparable methodologies and longer periods of follow-up are necessary to allow firm conclusions on the effects of breast feeding in some of these aspects.},

	abstract = {Bradford Hill's considerations published in 1965 had an enormous influence on attempts to separate causal from non-causal explanations of observed associations. These considerations were often applied as a checklist of criteria, although they were by no means intended to be used in this way by Hill himself. Hill, however, avoided defining explicitly what he meant by "causal effect". This paper provides a fresh point of view on Hill's considerations from the perspective of counterfactual causality. I argue that counterfactual arguments strongly contribute to the question of when to apply the Hill considerations. Some of the considerations, however, involve many counterfactuals in a broader causal system, and their heuristic value decreases as the complexity of a system increases; the danger of misapplying them can be high. The impacts of these insights for study design and data analysis are discussed. The key analysis tool to assess the applicability of Hill's considerations is multiple bias modelling (Bayesian methods and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis); these methods should be used much more frequently.},

METHODS: Using a sample of women with young children from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle V, 1995, the likelihood of breastfeeding was modeled using logistic regression techniques. In addition, single, live births from the NSFG 1988 and 1995 surveys were analyzed to model the effects of race and breastfeeding on infant mortality using Cox regression methods. RESULTS: After controlling for socioeconomic background and birth characteristics, race remained a strong predictor of breastfeeding. Black women were less likely to breastfeed than nonblack women were, and the primary reason indicated by black women for not breastfeeding was that they "preferred to bottle-feed." Analyses of infant mortality indicated that breastfeeding accounts for the race difference in infant mortality in the United States at least as well as low birth weight does. CONCLUSIONS: Race is an important predictor of breastfeeding, with most black women reporting that they "preferred bottle-feeding." Efforts to increase breastfeeding of infants in the black community should help narrow the racial gap in infant mortality.},

@article{Joseph2004,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional perinatal epidemiology appears to embrace fallacious concepts of risk. The use of incorrect denominators for perinatal rates is commonplace both for straightforward indices such as the gestational age-specific labor induction rate and also for the more conceptually challenging indices such as the gestational age-specific neonatal mortality rate. As a consequence, perinatology is beset by several conondrums including the paradox of intersecting perinatal mortality curves. PROPOSITION: These traditions are ideally replaced by alternative concepts that may be derived a priori and measured using indices such as presented here: the incidence of birth (i.e., the gestational age-specific birth rate), the incidence of growth restriction (i.e., the gestational age-specific growth-restriction rate) and the incidence of death (i.e., the age-specific mortality rate). RESULTS: The incidence of birth, growth restriction, and death quantify the core phenomena in perinatology and reveal congruent and coherent patterns of occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: These new indices can free perinatal epidemiology from erroneous concepts of risk and resolve the paradoxal phenomena that plague the perinatal domain. They also permit the development of a theoretical framework for obstetric intervention, which in recent years has been based exclusively on empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {Establishing cause-effect relationships is a standard goal of empirical science. Once the presence of a causal relationship is established, the precise causal mechanism involved becomes a topic of interest. A particularly popular type of mechanism analysis concerns questions of mediation, that is to what extent an effect is direct, and to what extent it is mediated by a third variable. A semiparametric theory has recently been proposed which allows multiply robust estimation of direct and mediated marginal effect functionals in observational studies (Tchetgen Tchetgen & Shpitser, 2012). In this paper we extend the new theory to handle parametric models of natural direct and indirect effects within levels of pre-exposure variables with an identity or log link function, where the model for the observed data likelihood is otherwise unrestricted. We show that estimation is generally not feasible in this model because of the curse of dimensionality associated with the required estimation of auxiliary conditional densities or expectations, given high-dimensional covariates. Thus, we consider multiply robust estimation and propose a more general model which assumes that a subset but not all of several working models holds.},

	abstract = {The causal effect of a treatment on an outcome is generally mediated by several intermediate variables. Estimation of the component of the causal effect of a treatment that is not mediated by an intermediate variable (the direct effect of the treatment) is often relevant to mechanistic understanding and to the design of clinical and public health interventions. Robins, Greenland and Pearl develop counterfactual definitions for two types of direct effects, natural and controlled, and discuss assumptions, beyond those of sequential randomization, required for the identifiability of natural direct effects. Building on their earlier work and that of others, this article provides an alternative counterfactual definition of a natural direct effect, the identifiability of which is based only on the assumption of sequential randomization. In addition, a novel approach to direct effect estimation is presented, based on assuming a model directly on the natural direct effect, possibly conditional on a subset of the baseline covariates. Inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators, double robust inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators, likelihood-based estimators, and targeted maximum likelihood-based estimators are proposed for the unknown parameters of this novel causal model.},

	abstract = {Propensity scores are widely adopted in observational research because they enable adjustment for high-dimensional confounders without requiring models for their association with the outcome of interest. The results of statistical analyses based on stratification, matching or inverse weighting by the propensity score are therefore less susceptible to model extrapolation than those based solely on outcome regression models. This is attractive because extrapolation in outcome regression models may be alarming, yet difficult to diagnose, when the exposed and unexposed individuals have very different covariate distributions. Standard regression adjustment for the propensity score forms an alternative to the aforementioned propensity score methods, but the benefits of this are less clear because it still involves modelling the outcome in addition to the propensity score. In this article, we develop novel insights into the properties of this adjustment method. We demonstrate that standard tests of the null hypothesis of no exposure effect (based on robust variance estimators), as well as particular standardised effects obtained from such adjusted regression models, are robust against misspecification of the outcome model when a propensity score model is correctly specified; they are thus not vulnerable to the aforementioned problem of extrapolation. We moreover propose efficient estimators for these standardised effects, which retain a useful causal interpretation even when the propensity score model is misspecified, provided the outcome regression model is correctly specified.},

We consider the context of an instrumental variable analysis with a binary outcome for estimating a causal risk ratio. The semiparametric generalized method of moments and structural mean model frameworks use estimating equations for parameter estimation. In this paper, we demonstrate that lack of identification can occur in either of these frameworks, especially if the instrument is weak. In particular, the estimating equations may have no solution or multiple solutions. We investigate the relationship between the strength of the instrument and the proportion of simulated data sets for which there is a unique solution of the estimating equations. We see that this proportion does not appear to depend greatly on the sample size, particularly for weak instruments (rho(2) </= 0.01). Poor identification was observed in a considerable proportion of simulated data sets for instruments explaining up to 10% of the variance in the exposure with sample sizes up to 1 million. In an applied example considering the causal effect of body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) on the probability of early menarche, estimates and standard errors from an automated optimization routine were misleading.},

Despite the various estimation methods and statistical routines being developed, a unified approach for effect estimation under different effect decomposition scenarios is still needed for epidemiologic research. G-computation offers such unification and has been used for total effect and joint controlled direct effect estimation settings, involving different types of exposure and outcome variables. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of parametric g-computation in estimating various components of the total effect, including (1) natural direct and indirect effects, (2) standard and stochastic controlled direct effects, and (3) reference and mediated interaction effects, using Monte Carlo simulations in standard statistical software. For each study subject, we estimated their nested potential outcomes corresponding to the (mediated) effects of an intervention on the exposure wherein the mediator was allowed to attain the value it would have under a possible counterfactual exposure intervention, under a pre-specified distribution of the mediator independent of any causes, or under a fixed controlled value. A final regression of the potential outcome on the exposure intervention variable was used to compute point estimates and bootstrap was used to obtain confidence intervals. Through contrasting different potential outcomes, this analytical framework provides an intuitive way of estimating effects under the recently introduced 3- and 4-way effect decomposition. This framework can be extended to complex multivariable and longitudinal mediation settings.},

This method of exact permutation inference may be used with many forms of covariance adjustment, including robust regression and locally weighted smoothers. The method is then generalized to observational studies where treatments were not randomly assigned, so that sensitivity to hidden biases must be examined. Adjustments using an instrumental variable are also discussed. The methods are illustrated using data from two observational studies.},

@article{Tchetgen2014c,
	abstract = {Natural direct and indirect effects formalize traditional notions of mediation analysis into a rigorous causal framework and have recently received considerable attention in epidemiology and in social sciences. Sufficient conditions for the identification of natural direct effects were formulated by Judea Pearl under a nonparametric structural equations model, which assumes certain independencies between potential outcomes. A common situation in epidemiology is that a confounder of the mediator-outcome relationship is itself affected by the exposure, in which case natural direct effects fail to be nonparametrically identified without additional assumptions, even under Pearl's nonparametric structural equations model. In this article, we show that when a single binary confounder of the mediator is affected by the exposure, the natural direct effect is nonparametrically identified under the model, assuming monotonicity about the effect of the exposure on the confounder. A similar result is shown to hold for a vector of binary confounders of the mediator under a certain independence assumption about the confounders. Finally, we show that natural direct effects are more generally identified if there is no additive mean interaction between the mediator and the confounders of the mediator affected by exposure. When correct, this latter assumption is particularly appealing because it does not require monotonicity of effects of the exposure. In addition, it places no restriction on the nature of the confounders of the mediator, which can be continuous or polytomous.},

@article{VanderWeele2010d,
	abstract = {A key question in many studies is how to divide the total effect of an exposure into a component that acts directly on the outcome and a component that acts indirectly, ie, through some intermediate. For example, one might be interested in the extent to which the effect of diet on blood pressure is mediated through sodium intake and the extent to which it operates through other pathways. In the context of such mediation analysis, even if the effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded, estimates of direct and indirect effects will be biased if control is not made for confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship. Often data are not collected on such mediator-outcome confounding variables; the results in this paper allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their estimates of direct and indirect effects to the biases from such confounding. Specifically, the paper provides formulas for the bias in estimates of direct and indirect effects due to confounding of the exposure-mediator relationship and of the mediator-outcome relationship. Under some simplifying assumptions, the formulas are particularly easy to use in sensitivity analysis. The bias formulas are illustrated by examples in the literature concerning direct and indirect effects in which mediator-outcome confounding may be present.},

	abstract = {Measuring and monitoring socioeconomic health inequalities are critical for understanding the impact of policy decisions. However, the measurement of health inequality is far from value neutral, and one can easily present the measure that best supports one's chosen conclusion or selectively exclude measures. Improving people's understanding of the often implicit value judgments is therefore important to reduce the risk that researchers mislead or policymakers are misled. While the choice between relative and absolute inequality is already value laden, further complexities arise when, as is often the case, health variables have both a lower and upper bound, and thus can be expressed in terms of either attainments or shortfalls, such as for mortality/survival.We bring together the recent parallel discussions from epidemiology and health economics regarding health inequality measurement and provide a deeper understanding of the different value judgments within absolute and relative measures expressed both in attainments and shortfalls, by graphically illustrating both hypothetical and real examples. We show that relative measures in terms of attainments and shortfalls have distinct value judgments, highlighting that for health variables with two bounds the choice is no longer only between an absolute and a relative measure but between an absolute, an attainment- relative and a shortfall-relative one. We illustrate how these three value judgments can be combined onto a single graph which shows the rankings according to all three measures, and illustrates how the three measures provide ethical benchmarks against which to judge the difference in inequality between populations.},

@article{Asada2010,
	abstract = {Context: In a recent article in this journal, Sam Harper and his colleagues (2010) call for increased awareness and open dialogue of moral judgments underlying health inequality measures. They recommend that analysts use relative inequality measures when concerned only about health inequality but use absolute inequality measures when also concerned about other issues, such as the overall level of population health and the level of health for each group in the population. Methods: Using a simple, hypothetical example, this commentary shows that the relationships among inequality, the absolute level for each group, and the overall level in the population are more complex than suggested by the analysis by Harper and his colleagues. Findings: First, analysts must make the choice of absolute or relative inequality measures, separately, for single- and multiple-population cases. Second, in the single-population cases, analysts can use both relative and absolute inequality measures when concerned only about health inequality independent of other considerations. Third, in almost all real-world multiple-population cases, when using either the absolute or relative inequality measure, the assessment of health inequality is influenced by the absolute level of health for each group. Conclusions: The choice between absolute and relative inequality measures is not about the independent normative significance of inequality, as Harper and his colleagues suggest. In choosing between absolute and relative measures, future work needs to integrate an empirical examination of values, a moral assessment of values, and a technical understanding of inequality measures.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In previous research, neighborhood deprivation was positively associated with body mass index (BMI) among adults with diabetes. We assessed whether the association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI is attributable, in part, to geographic variation in the availability of healthful and unhealthful food vendors. METHODS: Subjects were 16,634 participants of the Diabetes Study of Northern California, a multiethnic cohort of adults living with diabetes. Neighborhood deprivation and healthful (supermarket and produce) and unhealthful (fast food outlets and convenience stores) food vendor kernel density were calculated at each participant's residential block centroid. We estimated the total effect, controlled direct effect, natural direct effect, and natural indirect effect of neighborhood deprivation on BMI. Mediation effects were estimated using G-computation, a maximum likelihood substitution estimator of the G-formula that allows for complex data relations such as multiple mediators and sequential causal pathways. RESULTS: We estimated that if neighborhood deprivation was reduced from the most deprived to the least deprived quartile, average BMI would change by -0.73 units (95% confidence interval: -1.05, -0.32); however, we did not detect evidence of mediation by food vendor density. In contrast to previous findings, a simulated reduction in neighborhood deprivation from the most deprived to the least deprived quartile was associated with dramatic declines in both healthful and unhealthful food vendor density. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of food vendors, both healthful and unhealthful, did not appear to explain the association between neighborhood deprivation and BMI in this population of adults with diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological research has long observed a varying prevalence of hypertension across socioeconomic strata. However, patterns of association and underlying causal mechanisms are poorly understood in sub-Saharan Africa. Using education and income as indicators, we investigated the extent to which socioeconomic status is linked to blood pressure in the first wave of the National Income Dynamics Study--a South African longitudinal study of more than 15,000 adults--and whether bio-behavioural risk factors mediate the association. METHODS: In a cross-sectional analysis, structural equation modelling was employed to estimate the effect of socioeconomic status on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and to assess the role of a set of bio-behavioural risk factors in explaining the observed relationships. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, race and antihypertensive treatment, higher education and income were independently associated with higher diastolic blood pressure in men. In women higher education predicted lower values of both diastolic and systolic blood pressure while higher income predicted lower systolic blood pressure. In both genders, body mass index was a strong mediator of an adverse indirect effect of socioeconomic status on blood pressure. Together with physical exercise, alcohol use, smoking and resting heart rate, body mass index therefore contributed substantially to mediation of the observed relationships in men. By contrast, in women unmeasured factors played a greater role. CONCLUSION: In countries undergoing epidemiological transition, effects of socioeconomic status on blood pressure may vary by gender. In women, factors other than those listed above may have substantial role in mediating the association and merit investigation.},

The goal of the current study was to extend previously found links between lifetime discrimination, alcohol use, and alcohol problems as well as to elucidate the affective mechanisms underlying these associations, as moderated by gender. METHOD: A multiple-groups structural equation model was computed using survey data collected from 619 students from a historically Black college/university. RESULTS: The final model provided excellent fit to the data, explaining 6% of the variance in alcohol consumption and 37% of the variance in alcohol problems. Discrimination was a significant predictor of alcohol-related problems but not, by and large, level of use. For men, anger-but not discrimination-specific anger-was a significant partial mediator of the link between discrimination and both alcohol use and alcohol problems. Depression partially mediated the link between discrimination and alcohol problems for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, for African Americans whose drinking leads to drinking-related problems, discrimination and poor affective self-regulation are highly relevant and predictive factors, especially for men.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prospective data tested a "differential mediation" hypothesis: The relations (found in previous research) between perceived racial discrimination and physical health status versus health-impairing behavior (problematic substance use) are mediated by two different types of affective reactions, internalizing and externalizing. METHOD: The sample included 680 African American women from the Family and Community Health Study (M age = 37 years at Time 1; 45 years at Time 4). Four waves of data were analyzed. Perceived discrimination was assessed, along with anxiety and depression (internalizing) and hostility/anger (externalizing) as mediators, and physical health status and problematic substance use (drinking) as outcomes. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling indicated that discrimination predicted increases in both externalizing and internalizing reactions. These affective responses, in turn, predicted subsequent problematic substance use and physical health status, respectively, also controlling for earlier reports. In each case, the indirect effects from discrimination through the affective mediator to the specific health outcome were significant and consistent with the differential mediation hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived racial discrimination is associated with increases in internalizing and externalizing reactions among Black women, but these reactions are related to different health outcomes. Changes in internalizing are associated with self-reported changes in physical health status, whereas changes in externalizing are associated with changes in substance use problems. Discussion focuses on the processes whereby discrimination affects health behavior and physical health status.},

	abstract = {Mental health functioning in American Indian youth is an understudied topic. Given the increased rates of depression and anxiety in this population, further research is needed. Using multiple group structural equation modeling, the current study illuminates the effect of ethnic identity on anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and externalizing behavior in a group of Lumbee adolescents and a group of Caucasian, African American, and Latino/Hispanic adolescents. This study examined two possible pathways (i.e., future optimism and self-esteem) through which ethnic identity is associated with adolescent mental health. The sample (N = 4,714) is 28.53% American Indian (Lumbee) and 51.38% female. The study findings indicate that self-esteem significantly mediated the relationships between ethnic identity and anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and externalizing behavior for all racial/ethnic groups (i.e., the total sample). Future optimism significantly mediated the relationship between ethnic identity and externalizing behavior for all racial/ethnic groups and was a significant mediator between ethnic identity and depressive symptoms for American Indian youth only. Fostering ethnic identity in all youth serves to enhance mental health functioning, but is especially important for American Indian youth due to the collective nature of their culture.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use structural modeling to test a hypothesized model of causal pathways related with prediabetes among older adults in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 2,230 older adults (>/= 50 years) without diabetes included in the morning fasting sample of the 2001-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Demographic data included age, income, marital status, race/ethnicity, and education. Behavioral data included physical activity (metabolic equivalent hours per week for vigorous or moderate muscle strengthening, walking/biking, and house/yard work), and poor diet (refined grains, red meat, added sugars, solid fats, and high-fat dairy). Structural-equation modeling was performed to examine the interrelationships among these variables with family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, BMI, large waist (waist circumference: women, >/= 35 inches; men, >/= 40 inches), triglycerides >/= 200 mg/dL, and total and HDL (>/= 60 mg/dL) cholesterol. RESULTS: After dropping BMI and total cholesterol, our best-fit model included three single factors: socioeconomic position (SEP), physical activity, and poor diet. Large waist had the strongest direct effect on prediabetes (0.279), followed by male sex (0.270), SEP (-0.157), high blood pressure (0.122), family history of diabetes (0.070), and age (0.033). Physical activity had direct effects on HDL (0.137), triglycerides (-0.136), high blood pressure (-0.132), and large waist (-0.067); poor diet had direct effects on large waist (0.146) and triglycerides (0.148). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that, while including factors known to be associated with high risk of developing prediabetes, large waist circumference had the strongest direct effect. The direct effect of SEP on prediabetes suggests mediation by some unmeasured factor(s).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanisms through which marital status exerts long-term effects on depressive symptoms among women and to evaluate the relative importance of psychological, social and financial resources in mediating this relationship. METHODS: Data came from 6107 female respondents to a nationally representative longitudinal data set from the USA (National Survey of Families and Households 1987-1988/1992-1994). Mediation was investigated using semi-longitudinal structural equation modelling and bias-corrected bootstrapped CIs. Latent constructs with multiple indicators were used to measure depressive symptoms, primary and secondary social integration and self-esteem. RESULTS: The total effect of marital status on subsequent depressive symptoms was statistically significant for all marital statuses relative to those in first marriages controlling for age, education, race, number of children younger than 5 in the household, T1 depressive symptoms and marital status transitions between waves; all groups experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms than those in first marriages. These effects were completely mediated for never-married women and partially mediated for separated/divorced, widowed and cohabiting women. Adjusted household income was the largest mediator for the separated/divorced, widowed and never-married, but primary social integration also played a role. Self-esteem was the only significant mediator for the remarried and cohabiting and was also important in explaining differences between the first-married and separated/divorced. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the reasons why marital status has an influence on subsequent depressive symptoms varies depending on the specific marital status being compared with the married.},

The data were obtained from the United States records (N = 8,795) of the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children 2005/2006 Survey, in grades 6 through 10. The analyses employed multiple indicator multiple cause and structural equation models. Adolescent substance use was measured by frequencies of alcohol use, being drunk, and cigarette and marijuana use in the past month. Peer influence had a direct influence on adolescent substance use. Maternal knowledge had both direct and indirect influences on adolescent substance use through its negative association with substance-using peers, whereas paternal knowledge only had an indirect influence. Parental knowledge and peer substance use totally mediated differences in adolescent substance use by grade; differences between Caucasian and African-American or Hispanic adolescents; and differences between adolescents from two-parent families and those from single-mother, single-father or mother-stepfather families. Parental knowledge and peer substance were important mediators which largely accounted for variability in the prevalence of adolescent substance use by grade, race/ethnicity, and family structure.},

Structured interviews assessed exposure to community and family violence, parental monitoring and warmth, as well as substance abuse and conduct problems. Structural equation modeling provided evidence of a mediation model that fits European Americans but is less predictive for African Americans. For European Americans, findings suggest greater exposure to community violence is associated with more externalizing problems, and also indirectly effects problems by disrupting parental monitoring. Although family violence relates to less parental warmth, no association exits between warmth and externalizing problems. Unmeasured variables that contribute to racial differences may explain how violence impacts African American teens.},

@article{Lin2008,
	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the role of obesity in the development of the metabolic syndrome (MS). A total of 3,596 whites aged 19 years and above, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, were included for analysis. Anthropometric measurements, biochemical profiles, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to elucidate a pathway in which obesity initiated the cascade leading to full MS. The results of SEM demonstrated that obesity was positively associated with elevated CRP level (B = 0.05, P < 0.001). This higher inflammatory state directed to insulin resistance (B = 0.32, P < 0.001), which in turn was positively associated with dyslipidemia (B = 0.06, P < 0.001). Obesity could also directly and positively affect blood pressure (B = 0.51, P < 0.001), without the mediation of insulin resistance and/or inflammation. The results of the cross-sectional analysis in the white subjects have shown that obesity has a strong influence on hypertension that obtains little additional influence from inflammation or insulin resistance. The metabolic profile in the NHANES group has been confirmatory with the statement that there is a sequential effect from obesity to inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This approach has allowed to inferring important biological insights about the nature of the relationships among the components of MS.},

Other racial/ethnic minority populations also have elevated disease risk for some health conditions. This paper considers the complex ways in which race and socioeconomic status (SES) combine to affect health. SES accounts for much of the observed racial disparities in health. Nonetheless, racial differences often persist even at "equivalent" levels of SES. Racism is an added burden for nondominant populations. Individual and institutional discrimination, along with the stigma of inferiority, can adversely affect health by restricting socioeconomic opportunities and mobility. Racism can also directly affect health in multiple ways. Residence in poor neighborhoods, racial bias in medical care, the stress of experiences of discrimination and the acceptance of the societal stigma of inferiority can have deleterious consequences for health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that birth weight is not on the causal pathway to infant mortality, at least among "normal" births (i.e. those located in the central part of the birth weight distribution), and that US racial disparities (African American versus European American) may be underestimated. Here these hypotheses are tested by examining the role of birth weight on racial disparities in infant mortality. METHODS: A two-component Covariate Density Defined mixture of logistic regressions model is used to decompose racial disparities, 1) into disparities due to "normal" versus "compromised" components of the birth cohort, and 2) further decompose these components into indirect effects, which are associated with birth weight, versus direct effects, which are independent of birth weight. RESULTS: The results indicate that a direct effect is responsible for the racial disparity in mortality among "normal" births. No indirect effect of birth weight is observed despite significant disparities in birth weight. Among "compromised" births, an indirect effect is responsible for the disparity, which is consistent with disparities in birth weight. However, there is also a direct effect among "compromised" births that reduces the racial disparity in mortality. This direct effect is responsible for the "pediatric paradox" and maybe due to differential fetal loss. Model-based adjustment for this effect indicates that racial disparities corrected for fetal loss could be as high as 3 or 4 fold. This estimate is higher than the observed racial disparities in infant mortality (2.1 for both sexes). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that birth weight is not on the causal pathway to infant mortality among "normal" births, although birth weight could play a role among "compromised" births. The overall size of the US racial disparities in infant mortality maybe considerably underestimated in the observed data possibly due to racial disparities in fetal loss.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Higher rates of sepsis have been reported in minorities. OBJECTIVES: To explore racial differences in the incidence and associated case fatality of severe sepsis, accounting for clinical, social, health care service delivery, and geographic characteristics. METHODS: Retrospective population-based cohort study using hospital discharge and U.S. Census data for all persons (n = 71,102,655) living in 68 hospital referral regions in six states. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age-, sex- and race-standardized severe sepsis incidence and inpatient case fatality rates, adjusted incidence rate ratios, and adjusted intensive care unit (ICU) admission and case fatality rate differences. Of 8,938,111 nonfederal hospitalizations, 282,292 had severe sepsis. Overall, blacks had the highest age- and sex-standardized population-based incidence (6.08/1,000 vs. 4.06/1,000 for Hispanics and 3.58/1,000 for whites) and ICU case fatality (32.1 vs. 30.4% for Hispanics and 29.3% for whites, P < 0.0001). Adjusting for differences in poverty in their region of residence, blacks still had a higher population-based incidence of severe sepsis (adjusted rate ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.42-1.46]) than whites, but Hispanics had a lower incidence (adjusted rate ratio, 0.91 [0.90-0.92]). Among patients with severe sepsis admitted to the ICU, adjustments for clinical characteristics and the treating hospital fully explained blacks' higher ICU case fatality. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adjusted black incidence and the lower Hispanic incidence may reflect residual confounding, or it could signal biologic differences in susceptibility. Focused interventions to improve processes and outcomes of care at the hospitals that disproportionately treat blacks could narrow disparities in overall mortality from severe sepsis.},

	abstract = {Racial/ethnic health disparities are a primary focus of epidemiologic research, encompassing both sociological hypotheses about differential treatment as well as biomedical hypotheses about distinctive etiologic processes that might underlie observed disparities. These two main currents in disparities research are often pitted against one another as opposing paradigms. Despite contentious debate about the balance between these hypotheses in the etiology of existing disparities, one consideration that has been largely ignored is that there are important distinctions in the statistical justifications for these two types of inferences. In this article, I review the foundations of causal inference in etiologic epidemiology as applied to studies of racial/ethnic health disparities. I describe normative applications of quantitative techniques for causal inference as they are practiced in research on discrimination in health care and also for research on innate predisposition. I then show why the latter is an injudicious application of this statistical methodology, and illustrate this point with the example of an influential study in the biomedical literature that purported to demonstrate a lesser response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in black as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction.},

	abstract = {The natural direct effect (NDE), or the effect of an exposure on an outcome if an intermediate variable was set to the level it would have been in the absence of the exposure, is often of interest to investigators. In general, the statistical parameter associated with the NDE is difficult to estimate in the non-parametric model, particularly when the intermediate variable is continuous or high dimensional. In this article, we introduce a new causal parameter called the natural direct effect among the untreated, discuss identifiability assumptions, propose a sensitivity analysis for some of the assumptions, and show that this new parameter is equivalent to the NDE in a randomized controlled trial. We also present a targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE), a locally efficient, double robust substitution estimator for the statistical parameter associated with this causal parameter. The TMLE can be applied to problems with continuous and high dimensional intermediate variables, and can be used to estimate the NDE in a randomized controlled trial with such data. Additionally, we define and discuss the estimation of three related causal parameters: the natural direct effect among the treated, the indirect effect among the untreated and the indirect effect among the treated.},

@article{Thomas2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and iron deficiencies frequently co-exist. It is now appreciated that mechanistic interactions between iron and vitamin D metabolism may underlie these associations. OBJECTIVE: We examined interrelations between iron and vitamin D status and their regulatory hormones in pregnant adolescents, who are a group at risk of both suboptimal vitamin D and suboptimal iron status. DESIGN: The trial was a prospective longitudinal study of 158 pregnant adolescents (aged </=18 y). Maternal circulating biomarkers of vitamin D and iron were determined at midgestation ( approximately 25 wk) and delivery ( approximately 40 wk). Linear regression was used to assess associations between vitamin D and iron status indicators. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to generate the OR of anemia as a function of vitamin D status. A mediation analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect relations between vitamin D status, hemoglobin, and erythropoietin in maternal serum. RESULTS: Maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was positively associated with maternal hemoglobin at both midgestation and at delivery (P < 0.01 for both). After adjustment for age at enrollment and race, the odds of anemia at delivery was 8 times greater in adolescents with delivery 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L than in those with 25(OH)D concentrations >/=50 nmol/L (P <0.001). Maternal 25(OH)D was inversely associated with erythropoietin at both midgestation (P <0.05) and delivery (P <0.001). The significant relation observed between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin could be explained by a direct relation between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin and an indirect relation that was mediated by erythropoietin. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of pregnant adolescents, suboptimal vitamin D status was associated with increased risk of iron insufficiency and vice versa. These findings emphasize the need for screening for multiple nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy and greater attention to overlapping metabolic pathways when selecting prenatal supplementation regimens.},

When an individual's race can change (as in Brazil), race is not an attribute but a dynamic characteristic dependent on other social circumstances. In the United States, an individual's race cannot change and thus is considered an individual attribute. As such, social statisticians may have measured racial classification correctly. The major error is in how race has been interpreted. The author suggests a new language to express things that our current language handles inadequately.

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that race is perceived through another's facial features, such as skin color. In the present research, we demonstrate that cues to social status that often surround a face systematically change the perception of its race. Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along White-Black morph continua and that were presented with high-status or low-status attire. Low-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1). When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants' hand movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue) before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception. Together, the findings show how stereotypes interact with physical cues to shape person categorization, and suggest that social and contextual factors guide the perception of race.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine racial/ethnic disparities in mastectomy practice and explore mediating factors to explain the disparity. METHODS: Participants included 989 females aged 30-79 years, from a population-based study of newly diagnosed (primary in situ/invasive) breast cancer patients, in Chicago, Illinois, from 2005 to 2008, who completed an interview. Medical records were also abstracted for tumor, diagnostic, and treatment information. Multivariable logistic regression models with model-based standardization were used to estimate risk differences. Differences in rescaled coefficients were used to estimate the proportion of the disparity that could be mediated by patient and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: Mastectomy prevalence overall was 40 %. Factors significantly associated with increased rates of mastectomy (p < 0.05) included the following: non-Hispanic (nH) black and Hispanic race/ethnicity; younger age at diagnosis; lower socioeconomic status (SES); lack of recency of and adherence to screening mammography; and higher tumor pathologic stage and grade. In adjusted models (age, body mass index, comorbidity), compared to nH white patients, mastectomy was increased by 10 % points in both nH black (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.03, 0.18; p = 0.007) and Hispanic (95 % CI 0.01, 0.19; p = 0.028) patients. After accounting for the proportion of disparity mediated by tumor stage, the disparity was reduced by about a third in nH black (risk difference = 0.07, 95 % CI -0.01, 0.14) and half in Hispanic patients (risk difference = 0.04, 95 % CI -0.05, 0.13). Additional control for mediation by SES and other tumor-related factors almost completely eliminated the nH black:nH white disparity. CONCLUSIONS: The best approach to reducing the racial/ethnic disparity in mastectomy rates would be to intervene on factors that could affect stage at diagnosis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between race/ethnicity and breast cancer-specific survival according to subtype and explore mediating factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were women presenting with stage I to III breast cancer between January 2000 and December 2007 at National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers with survival follow-up through December 2009. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare breast cancer-specific survival among Asians (n = 533), Hispanics (n = 1,122), and blacks (n = 1,345) with that among whites (n = 14,268), overall and stratified by subtype (luminal A like, luminal B like, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 type, and triple negative). Model estimates were used to derive mediation proportion and 95% CI for selected risk factors. RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted models, overall, blacks had 21% higher risk of breast cancer-specific death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.45). For estrogen receptor-positive tumors, black and white survival differences were greatest within 2 years of diagnosis (years 0 to 2: HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.34 to 5.24; year 2 to end of follow-up: HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.00). Blacks were 76% and 56% more likely to die as a result of luminal A-like and luminal B-like tumors, respectively. No disparities were observed for triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-type tumors. Asians and Hispanics were less likely to die as a result of breast cancer compared with whites (Asians: HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.85; Hispanics: HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95). For blacks, tumor characteristics and stage at diagnosis were significant disparity mediators. Body mass index was an important mediator for blacks and Asians. CONCLUSION: Racial disparities in breast cancer survival vary by tumor subtype. Interventions are needed to reduce disparities, particularly in the first 2 years after diagnosis among black women with estrogen receptor-positive tumors.},

@article{Tchetgen2012c,
	abstract = {While estimation of the marginal (total) causal effect of a point exposure on an outcome is arguably the most common objective of experimental and observational studies in the health and social sciences, in recent years, investigators have also become increasingly interested in mediation analysis. Specifically, upon evaluating the total effect of the exposure, investigators routinely wish to make inferences about the direct or indirect pathways of the effect of the exposure, through a mediator variable or not, that occurs subsequently to the exposure and prior to the outcome. Although powerful semiparametric methodologies have been developed to analyze observational studies that produce double robust and highly efficient estimates of the marginal total causal effect, similar methods for mediation analysis are currently lacking. Thus, this paper develops a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about so-called marginal natural direct and indirect causal effects, while appropriately accounting for a large number of pre-exposure confounding factors for the exposure and the mediator variables. Our analytic framework is particularly appealing, because it gives new insights on issues of efficiency and robustness in the context of mediation analysis. In particular, we propose new multiply robust locally efficient estimators of the marginal natural indirect and direct causal effects, and develop a novel double robust sensitivity analysis framework for the assumption of ignorability of the mediator variable.},

However, race reflects multiple dimensions of social inequality and individual and household indicators of SES capture relevant but limited aspects of this phenomenon. Research is needed that will comprehensively characterize the critical pathogenic features of social environments and identify how they combine with each other to affect health over the life course. Migration history and status are also important predictors of health and research is needed that will enhance understanding of the complex ways in which race, SES, and immigrant status combine to affect health. Fully capturing the role of race in health also requires rigorous examination of the conditions under which medical care and genetic factors can contribute to racial and SES differences in health. The paper identifies research priorities in all of these areas.},

	abstract = {Causal inference with interference is a rapidly growing area. The literature has begun to relax the "no-interference" assumption that the treatment received by one individual does not affect the outcomes of other individuals. In this paper we briefly review the literature on causal inference in the presence of interference when treatments have been randomized. We then consider settings in which causal effects in the presence of interference are not identified, either because randomization alone does not suffice for identification, or because treatment is not randomized and there may be unmeasured confounders of the treatment-outcome relationship. We develop sensitivity analysis techniques for these settings. We describe several sensitivity analysis techniques for the infectiousness effect which, in a vaccine trial, captures the effect of the vaccine of one person on protecting a second person from infection even if the first is infected. We also develop two sensitivity analysis techniques for causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding which generalize analogous techniques when interference is absent. These two techniques for unmeasured confounding are compared and contrasted.},

Using computer simulations, we compare the behaviour of common measures of association derived from case-control studies in the context of a malaria vaccine programme administered under complex transmission conditions. Several simplifying assumptions of previous workers have been relaxed and the simulated conditions are endemic rather than epidemic. The common estimators of association used in case-control studies remain unbiased only in limited circumstances. The term dependent happenings, first defined by Ross in 1916, is resurrected. Since the number of people becoming infected is dependent on the number of people already infected, control programmes in infectious diseases produce direct as well as indirect effects. Three different study designs with different pairs of comparison populations are defined. The choice of comparison population can be used to differentiate direct from indirect effects. In order to clarify the direct effects of a vaccination programme the comparison groups must be subjected to identical transmission intensities. In contrast, the referent group must remain unaffected by consequences of the intervention to determine indirect effects.},

	abstract = {<p>The most common modeling approaches to understanding incidence, prevalence and control of chronic diseases in populations, such as statistical regression models, are limited when it comes to dealing with the complexity of those problems. Those complex adaptive systems have characteristics such as emerging properties, self-organization and feedbacks, which structure the system stability and resistance to changes. Recently, system science approaches have been proposed to deal with the range, complexity, and multifactor nature of those public health problems. In this paper we applied a multilevel systemic approach to create an integrated, coherent, and increasingly precise conceptual framework, capable of aggregating different partial or specialized studies, based on the challenges of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health -- ELSA-Brasil. The failure to control blood pressure found in several of the study's subjects was discussed, based on the proposed model, analyzing different loops, time lags, and feedback that influence this outcome in a population with high educational level, with reasonably good health services access. We were able to identify the internal circularities and cycles that generate the system's resistance to change. We believe that this study can contribute to propose some new possibilities of the research agenda and to the discussion of integrated actions in the field of public health.</p>},

	abstract = {Objectives. Awareness of and support for systems thinking and modeling in the public health field are growing, yet there are many practical challenges to implementation. We sought to identify and describe these challenges from the perspectives of practicing public health professionals. Methods. A systems-based methodology, concept mapping, was used in a study of 133 participants from 2 systems-based public health initiatives (the Initiative for the Study and Implementation of Systems and the Syndemics Prevention Network). This method identified 100 key challenges to implementation of systems thinking and modeling in public health work. Results. The project resulted in a map identifying 8 categories of challenges and the dynamic interactions among them. Conclusions. Implementation by public health professionals of the 8 simple rules we derived from the clusters in the map identified here will help to address challenges and improve the organization of systems that protect the public's health.},

	abstract = {Public health research and practice have been guided by a cognitive, rational paradigm where inputs produce linear, predictable changes in outputs. However, the conceptual and statistical assumptions underlying this paradigm may be flawed. In particular, this perspective does not adequately account for nonlinear and quantum influences on human behavior. We propose that health behavior change is better understood through the lens of chaos theory and complex adaptive systems. Key relevant principles include that behavior change (1) is often a quantum event; (2) can resemble a chaotic process that is sensitive to initial conditions, highly variable, and difficult to predict; and (3) occurs within a complex adaptive system with multiple components, where results are often greater than the sum of their parts.},

@article{Jayasinghe2011,
	abstract = {The mechanistic interpretation of reality can be traced to the influential work by Rene Descartes and Sir Isaac Newton. Their theories were able to accurately predict most physical phenomena relating to motion, optics and gravity. This paradigm had at least three principles and approaches: reductionism, linearity and hierarchy. These ideas appear to have influenced social scientists and the discourse on population health. In contrast, Complexity Science takes a more holistic view of systems. It views natural systems as being 'open', with fuzzy borders, constantly adapting to cope with pressures from the environment. These are called Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). The sub-systems within it lack stable hierarchies, and the roles of agency keep changing. The interactions with the environment and among sub-systems are non-linear interactions and lead to self-organisation and emergent properties. Theoretical frameworks such as epi+demos+cracy and the ecosocial approach to health have implicitly used some of these concepts of interacting dynamic sub-systems. Using Complexity Science we can view population health outcomes as an emergent property of CAS, which has numerous dynamic non-linear interactions among its interconnected sub-systems or agents. In order to appreciate these sub-systems and determinants, one should acquire a basic knowledge of diverse disciplines and interact with experts from different disciplines. Strategies to improve health should be multi-pronged, and take into account the diversity of actors, determinants and contexts. The dynamic nature of the system requires that the interventions are constantly monitored to provide early feedback to a flexible system that takes quick corrections.},

@article{Philippe1998,
	abstract = {The challenges posed by chronic illness have pointed out to epidemiologists the multifactorial complex nature of disease causality. This notion has been referred to as a web of causality. This web extends theoretically beyond risk markers. It includes determinants of emergence/non-emergence of disease. This web of determinants is a form of complex system. Due to its complexity, the determinants within such system are not linked to each others in a linear, predictable manner only. Predictability is possible only on a short-term basis, and unpredictability sets in over the long run. Understanding such a system of determinants calls for articulation and testing of complex models which synthesize our knowledge of multiple determinants at many scales, both biological and otherwise. Given the complexity of this web and existing knowledge about the nonlinearity of such systems, the following question is posed: Can the challenge of studying causality be adequately addressed if emphasis continues to be placed on using tools and methods that are geared towards looking at such system from a linear paradigm? Or is it time to add to the epidemiologic research agenda the notion of nonlinearity and its relevant form of analytical approaches that are being tested in other disciplines? Furthermore, the question posed here applies as well to the study of determinants of health. Addressing determinants of heath adds further complexity to our task.},

We estimate this proportion by applying the partial likelihood function to two Cox models postulated on the same failure time variable. We show that the resultant estimator is asymptotically normal with a simple variance estimator. One can construct confidence intervals for the proportion by using the direct normal approximation to the point estimator or by using Fieller's theorem. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods are appropriate for practical use. We provide applications to HIV/AIDS clinical trials.},

	abstract = {We discuss the implementation of a criterion due to Prentice for the statistical validation of intermediate endpoints for chronic disease. The criterion involves examining in a cohort or intervention study whether an exposure or intervention effect, adjusted for the intermediate endpoint, is reduced to zero. For example, to examine whether serum cholesterol level is an intermediate endpoint for coronary heart disease (CHD), we may investigate the effect of the cholesterol lowering drug cholestyramine on CHD incidence adjusted for serum cholesterol levels. We show that use of this criterion will usually demand some form of model selection. When the unadjusted exposure or treatment effect is less than four times its standard error, the analysis can usually lead only to a weak form of validation, a conclusion that the data are not inconsistent with the validation criterion. More significant unadjusted exposure effects offer the potential for stronger types of validation statement such as 'the intermediate endpoint explains at least 50 per cent (or 75 per cent) of the exposure effect'.},

In a statistical model with unknown nuisance parameters, the efficiency of an estimator of a parameter usually increases when the nuisance parameters are known. However the opposite phenomenon can sometimes occur. In this paper, we elucidate the occurrence of this paradox by examining estimating functions. In particular, we focus on the projected estimating function, which is defined by the projection of the score function on to a given estimating function. A sufficient condition for the paradox to occur is the orthogonality of the two components of the projected estimating functions corresponding to parameters of interest and nuisance parameters. In addition, a numerical assessment is conducted in the context of a simple model to investigate the improvement of the asymptotic efficiency of estimators.},

Data are presented for maternal age, live-birth order, race and Hispanic origin, marital status, attendant at birth, method of delivery, period of gestation, birthweight, and plurality. Birth and fertility rates are presented by age, live-birth order, race and Hispanic origin, and marital status. Selected data by mother's state of residence and birth rates by age and race of father also are shown. Trends in fertility patterns and maternal and infant characteristics are described and interpreted. Methods-Descriptive tabulations of data reported on the birth certificates of the 3.93 million U.S. births that occurred in 2013 are presented. Results-A total of 3,932,181 births were registered in the United States in 2013, down less than 1% from 2012. The general fertility rate declined to 62.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. The teen birth rate fell 10%, to 26.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-19. Birth rates declined for women in their 20s and increased for most age groups of women aged 30 and over. The total fertility rate (estimated number of births over a woman's lifetime) declined 1% to 1,857.5 per 1,000 women. Measures of unmarried childbearing were down in 2013 from 2012. The cesarean delivery rate declined to 32.7%. The preterm birth rate declined for the seventh straight year to 11.39%, but the low birthweight rate was essentially unchanged at 8.02%. The twin birth rate rose 2% to 33.7 per 1,000 births; the triplet and higher-order multiple birth rate dropped 4% to 119.5 per 100,000 total births.},

This is the quest of General Systems Theory. It does not seek, of course, to establish a single, self-contained ``general theory of practically everything'' which will replace all the special theories of particular disciplines. Such a theory would be almost without content, for we always pay for generality by sacrificing content, and all we can say about practically everything is almost nothing. Somewhere however between the specific that has no meaning and the general that has no content there must be, for each purpose and at each level of abstraction, an optimum degree of generality. It is the contention of the General Systems Theorists that this optimum degree of generality in theory is not always reached by the particular sciences. },

	abstract = {A major focus of recent work on the spatial patterning of health has been the study of how features of residential environments or neighborhoods may affect health. Place effects on health emerge from complex interdependent processes in which individuals interact with each other and their environment and in which both individuals and environments adapt and change over time. Traditional epidemiologic study designs and statistical regression approaches are unable to examine these dynamic processes. These limitations have constrained the types of questions asked, the answers received, and the hypotheses and theoretical explanations that are developed. Agent-based models and other systems-dynamics models may help to address some of these challenges. Agent-based models are computer representations of systems consisting of heterogeneous microentities that can interact and change/adapt over time in response to other agents and features of the environment. Using these models, one can observe how macroscale dynamics emerge from microscale interactions and adaptations. A number of challenges and limitations exist for agent-based modeling. Nevertheless, use of these dynamic models may complement traditional epidemiologic analyses and yield additional insights into the processes involved and the interventions that may be most useful.},

There also appears to be conflicts between complex systems approaches and traditional statistical methodologies, both in terms of their underlying strategies and the languages they use. We argue that the conflicts are resolvable, and the sooner the better for the field. In this article, we show how statistical and systems science approaches can be reconciled, and how together they can advance solutions to complex problems. We do this by comparing the methods within a theoretical framework based on the work of population biologist Richard Levins.

	abstract = {Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert ``contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests that social networks may present an avenue for intervention against obesity. By using a simulation model in which artificial individuals were nested in a social network, we assessed whether interventions targeting highly networked individuals could help reduce population obesity. We compared the effects of targeting antiobesity interventions at the most connected individuals in a network with those targeting individuals at random. We tested 2 interventions, the first ``preventing'' obesity among 10% of the population at simulation outset and the second ``treating'' obesity among 10% of the obese population yearly, each in 2 separate simulations. One simulation featured a literature-based parameter for the network spread of obesity, and the other featured an artificially high parameter. Interventions that targeted highly networked individuals did not outperform at-random interventions in simulations featuring the literature-based parameter. However, in simulations featuring the artificially high parameter, the targeted prevention intervention outperformed the at-random intervention, whereas the treatment intervention implemented at random outperformed the targeted treatment intervention. Results were qualitatively similar across network topologies and intervention scales. Although descriptive studies suggest that social networks influence the spread of obesity, policies targeting well-connected individuals in social networks may not improve obesity reduction. We highlight and discuss the potential applications of counterfactual simulations in epidemiology.},

@article{El-Sayed2012a,
	abstract = {The past five years have seen a growth in the interest in systems approaches in epidemiologic research. These approaches may be particularly appropriate for social epidemiology. Social network analysis and agent-based models (ABMs) are two approaches that have been used in the epidemiologic literature. Social network analysis involves the characterization of social networks to yield inference about how network structures may influence risk exposures among those in the network. ABMs can promote population-level inference from explicitly programmed, micro-level rules in simulated populations over time and space. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of these models in social epidemiologic research, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Network analysis may be ideal for understanding social contagion, as well as the influences of social interaction on population health. However, network analysis requires network data, which may sacrifice generalizability, and causal inference from current network analytic methods is limited. ABMs are uniquely suited for the assessment of health determinants at multiple levels of influence that may couple with social interaction to produce population health. ABMs allow for the exploration of feedback and reciprocity between exposures and outcomes in the etiology of complex diseases. They may also provide the opportunity for counterfactual simulation. However, appropriate implementation of ABMs requires a balance between mechanistic rigor and model parsimony, and the precision of output from complex models is limited. Social network and agent-based approaches are promising in social epidemiology, but continued development of each approach is needed.},

	abstract = {Calls for the adoption of complex systems approaches, including agent-based modeling, in the field of epidemiology have largely centered on the potential for such methods to examine complex disease etiologies, which are characterized by feedback behavior, interference, threshold dynamics, and multiple interacting causal effects. However, considerable theoretical and practical issues impede the capacity of agent-based methods to examine and evaluate causal effects and thus illuminate new areas for intervention. We build on this work by describing how agent-based models can be used to simulate counterfactual outcomes in the presence of complexity. We show that these models are of particular utility when the hypothesized causal mechanisms exhibit a high degree of interdependence between multiple causal effects and when interference (i.e., one person's exposure affects the outcome of others) is present and of intrinsic scientific interest. Although not without challenges, agent-based modeling (and complex systems methods broadly) represent a promising novel approach to identify and evaluate complex causal effects, and they are thus well suited to complement other modern epidemiologic methods of etiologic inquiry.},

In contrast, the recently developed marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. We describe an MSM for repeated measures that parameterizes the marginal means of counterfactual outcomes corresponding to prespecified treatment regimes. The parameters of MSMs are estimated using a new class of estimators - inverse-probability of treatment weighted estimators. We used an MSM to estimate the effect of zidovudine therapy on mean CD4 count among HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. We estimated a potential expected increase of 5.4 (95 per cent confidence interval -1.8,12.7) CD4 lymphocytes/l per additional study visit while on zidovudine therapy. We also explain the theory and implementation of MSMs for repeated measures data and draw upon a simple example to illustrate the basic ideas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment selection for elderly patients with lung cancer must balance the benefits of curative/life-prolonging therapy and the risks of increased mortality due to comorbidities. Lung cancer trials generally exclude patients with comorbidities and current treatment guidelines do not specifically consider comorbidities, so treatment decisions are usually made on subjective individual-case basis. METHODS: Impacts of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy mono-treatment as well as combined chemo/radiation on one-year overall survival (compared to no-treatment) are studied for stage-specific lung cancer in 65+ y.o. patients. Methods of causal inference such as propensity score with inverse probability weighting (IPW) for time-independent and marginal structural model (MSM) for time-dependent treatments are applied to SEER-Medicare data considering the presence of comorbid diseases. RESULTS: 122,822 patients with stage I (26.8%), II (4.5%), IIIa (11.5%), IIIb (19.9%), and IV (37.4%) lung cancer were selected. Younger age, smaller tumor size, and fewer baseline comorbidities predict better survival. Impacts of radio- and chemotherapy increased and impact of surgery decreased with more advanced cancer stages. The effects of all therapies became weaker after adjustment for selection bias, however, the changes in the effects were minor likely due to the weak selection bias or incompleteness of the list of predictors that impacted treatment choice. MSM provides more realistic estimates of treatment effects than the IPW approach for time-independent treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Causal inference methods provide substantive results on treatment choice and survival of older lung cancer patients with realistic expectations of potential benefits of specific treatments. Applications of these models to specific subsets of patients can aid in the development of practical guidelines that help optimize lung cancer treatment based on individual patient characteristics.},

@article{Mendola2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is characterized by alterations in angiogenic factors that may increase neonatal morbidity independent of preterm birth. METHODS: We estimated the controlled direct effect of preeclampsia on neonatal outcomes independent of preterm birth among 200,103 normotensive and 10,507 preeclamptic singleton pregnancies in the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002-2008). Marginal structural models with stabilized inverse probability weights accounted for potential confounders in the pathway from preeclampsia to preterm birth to neonatal outcomes, including mediator-outcome confounders related to preeclampsia status, such as cesarean delivery. Controlled direct effects of preeclampsia on perinatal mortality, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, anemia, apnea, asphyxia, peri- or intraventricular hemorrhage, and cardiomyopathy were estimated for the hypothesized intervention of term delivery for all infants. RESULTS: When delivery was set at >/=37 weeks, preeclampsia increased the odds of perinatal mortality (odds ratio = 2.2 [95% confidence interval = 1.1-4.5], SGA = (1.9 [1.8-2.1]), NICU admission (1.9 [1.7-2.1]), respiratory distress syndrome (2.8 [2.0-3.7], transient tachypnea of the newborn (1.6 [1.3-1.9]), apnea (2.2 [1.6-3.1]), asphyxia (2.7 [1.5-4.9]), and peri- or intraventricular hemorrhage (3.2 [1.4-7.7]). No direct effect of preeclampsia at term was observed for anemia or cardiomyopathy. Our results appear robust in the presence of moderate confounding, and restriction to severe preeclampsia yielded similar findings. CONCLUSION: Preeclampsia was directly associated with adverse neonatal outcomes beyond morbidity mediated by preterm birth. Although severe neonatal outcomes were less common at later gestational ages, marginal structural models suggested elevated neonatal risk due to preeclampsia even if it was possible to deliver all infants at term.},

Further procedures have been proposed for testing the goodness-of-fit and comparing the fit of the latter models. This paper reviews the relationships between the various tests and model comparison methods, and, for the special case of two dichotomous risk factors, presents asymptotic power functions for tests of additivity and multiplicativity. For a range of sample sizes and factor effects, the powers of the tests are computed using both the asymptotic power function and simulation studies. The powers of the tests are very low in several commonly encountered situations. In addition, convergence to the asymptotic distribution appears slow for some of the statistics. The results also indicate that likelihood comparison procedures can provide a useful adjunct to the classical hypothesis-testing approach.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence and provide recommendations for the counselling and management of obese parturients. OUTCOMES: OUTCOMES evaluated include the impact of maternal obesity on the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. EVIDENCE: Literature was retrieved through searches of Statistics Canada, Medline, and The Cochrane Library on the impact of obesity in pregnancy on antepartum and intrapartum care, maternal morbidity and mortality, obstetrical anaesthesia, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to April 2009. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Maternal Fetal Medicine and Clinical Practice Obstetric Committees of the SOGC under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Implementation of the recommendations in this guideline should increase recognition of the issues clinicians need to be aware of when managing obese women in pregnancy, improve communication and consultation amongst the obstetrical care team, and encourage federal and provincial agencies to educate Canadians about the values of entering pregnancy with as healthy a weight as possible.},

@article{Kotas2015,
	abstract = {While modernization has dramatically increased lifespan, it has also witnessed the increasing prevalence of diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Such chronic, acquired diseases result when normal physiologic control goes awry and may thus be viewed as failures of homeostasis. However, while nearly every process in human physiology relies on homeostatic mechanisms for stability, only some have demonstrated vulnerability to dysregulation. Additionally, chronic inflammation is a common accomplice of the diseases of homeostasis, yet the basis for this connection is not fully understood. Here we review the design of homeostatic systems and discuss universal features of control circuits that operate at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. We suggest a framework for classification of homeostatic signals that is based on different classes of homeostatic variables they report on. Finally, we discuss how adaptability of homeostatic systems with adjustable set points creates vulnerability to dysregulation and disease. This framework highlights the fundamental parallels between homeostatic and inflammatory control mechanisms and provides a new perspective on the physiological origin of inflammation.},

	abstract = {The modern rise in obesity and its strong association with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have elicited interest in the underlying mechanisms of these pathologies. The discovery that obesity itself results in an inflammatory state in metabolic tissues ushered in a research field that examines the inflammatory mechanisms in obesity. Here, we summarize the unique features of this metabolic inflammatory state, termed metaflammation and defined as low-grade, chronic inflammation orchestrated by metabolic cells in response to excess nutrients and energy. We explore the effects of such inflammation in metabolic tissues including adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain and its contribution to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Another area in which many unknowns still exist is the origin or mechanism of initiation of inflammatory signaling in obesity. We discuss signals or triggers to the inflammatory response, including the possibility of endoplasmic reticulum stress as an important contributor to metaflammation. Finally, we examine anti-inflammatory therapies for their potential in the treatment of obesity-related insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.},

@article{Puzziferri2014,
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Bariatric surgery is an accepted treatment for obesity. Despite extensive literature, few studies report long-term follow-up in cohorts with adequate retention rates. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of evidence and treatment effectiveness 2 years after bariatric procedures for weight loss, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in severely obese adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from 1946 through May 15, 2014. Search terms included bariatric surgery, individual bariatric procedures, and obesity. Studies were included if they described outcomes for gastric bypass, gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy performed on patients with a body mass index of 35 or greater, had more than 2 years of outcome information, and had follow-up measures for at least 80% of the initial cohort. Two investigators reviewed each study and a third resolved study inclusion disagreements. FINDINGS: Of 7371 clinical studies reviewed, 29 studies (0.4%, 7971 patients) met inclusion criteria. All gastric bypass studies (6 prospective cohorts, 5 retrospective cohorts) and sleeve gastrectomy studies (2 retrospective cohorts) had 95% confidence intervals for the reported mean, median, or both exceeding 50% excess weight loss. This amount of excess weight loss occurred in 31% of gastric band studies (9 prospective cohorts, 5 retrospective cohorts). The mean sample-size-weighted percentage of excess weight loss for gastric bypass was 65.7% (n = 3544) vs 45.0% (n = 4109) for gastric band. Nine studies measured comorbidity improvement. For type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin <6.5% without medication), sample-size-weighted remission rates were 66.7% for gastric bypass (n = 428) and 28.6% for gastric band (n = 96). For hypertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg without medication), remission rates were 38.2% for gastric bypass ( n = 808) and 17.4% for gastric band (n = 247). For hyperlipidemia (cholesterol <200 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein >40 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein <160 mg/dL, and triglycerides <200 mg/dL), remission rates were 60.4% for gastric bypass (n = 477) and 22.7% for gastric band (n = 97). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Very few bariatric surgery studies report long-term results with sufficient patient follow-up to minimize biased results. Gastric bypass has better outcomes than gastric band procedures for long-term weight loss, type 2 diabetes control and remission, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Insufficient evidence exists regarding long-term outcomes for gastric sleeve resections.},

@article{Fock2013,
	abstract = {According to World Health Organization, in 2010 there were over 1 billion overweight adults worldwide with 400 million adults who were obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancers (prostate, colorectal, endometrial, and breast). Obese people may present to the gastroenterologists with gastroesophageal reflux, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and gallstones. It is important, therefore, to recognize and treat obesity. The main cause of obesity is an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended, although in a small number of cases, genetics and diseases such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's disease, depression, and use of medications such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants are responsible for fat accumulation in the body. The main treatment for obesity is dieting, augmented by physical exercise and supported by cognitive behavioral therapy. Calorie-restriction strategies are one of the most common dietary plans. Low-calorie diet refers to a diet with a total dietary calorie intake of 800-1500, while very low-calorie diet has less than 800 calories daily. These dietary regimes need to be balanced in macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fifty-five percent of the dietary calories should come from carbohydrates, 10% from proteins, and 30% from fats, of which 10% of total fat consist of saturated fats. After reaching the desired body weight, the amount of dietary calories consumed can be increased gradually to maintain a balance between calories consumed and calories expended. Regular physical exercise enhances the efficiency of diet through increase in the satiating efficiency of a fixed meal, and is useful for maintaining diet-induced weight loss. A meta-analysis by Franz found that by calorie restriction and exercise, weight loss of 5-8.5 kg was observed 6 months after intervention. After 48 months, a mean of 3-6 kg was maintained. In conclusion, there is evidence that obesity is preventable and treatable. Dieting and physical exercise can produce weight loss that can be maintained.},

@article{Schummers2015,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the absolute risks of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes based on small differences in prepregnancy body mass (eg, 10% of body mass or 10-20 pounds). METHODS: This population-based cohort study (N=226,958) was drawn from all singleton pregnancies in British Columbia (Canada) from 2004 to 2012. The relationships between prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (as a continuous, nonlinear variable) and adverse pregnancy outcomes were examined using logistic regression models. Analyses were adjusted for maternal age, height, parity, and smoking in pregnancy. Adjusted absolute risks of each outcome are reported according to incremental differences in prepregnancy BMI and weight in pounds. RESULTS: A 10% difference in prepregnancy BMI was associated with at least a 10% lower risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, indicated preterm delivery, macrosomia, and stillbirth. In contrast, larger differences in prepregnancy BMI (20-30% differences in BMI) were necessary to meaningfully reduce risks of cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, neonatal intensive care unit stay 48 hours or longer, and in-hospital newborn mortality. Prepregnancy BMI was not associated with risk of postpartum hemorrhage requiring intervention, severe maternal morbidity or maternal mortality, or spontaneous preterm delivery before 32 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: These results can inform prepregnancy weight loss counseling by defining achievable weight loss goals for patients that may reduce their risk of poor perinatal outcomes.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality, morbidity, and long-term disability, and these risks increase with decreasing gestational age. Obesity increases the risk of preterm delivery, but the associations between overweight and obesity and subtypes of preterm delivery are not clear. OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and risk of preterm delivery by gestational age and by precursors of preterm delivery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study of women with live singleton births in Sweden from 1992 through 2010. Maternal and pregnancy characteristics were obtained from the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of preterm deliveries (extremely, 22-27 weeks; very, 28-31 weeks; and moderately, 32-36 weeks). These outcomes were further characterized as spontaneous (related to preterm contractions or preterm premature rupture of membranes) and medically indicated preterm delivery (cesarean delivery before onset of labor or induced onset of labor). Risk estimates were adjusted for maternal age, parity, smoking, education, height, mother's country of birth, and year of delivery. RESULTS: Among 1,599,551 deliveries with information on early pregnancy BMI, 3082 were extremely preterm, 6893 were very preterm, and 67,059 were moderately preterm. Risks of extremely, very, and moderately preterm deliveries increased with BMI and the overweight and obesity-related risks were highest for extremely preterm delivery. Among normal-weight women (BMI 18.5-<25), the rate of extremely preterm delivery was 0.17%. As compared with normal-weight women, rates (%) and adjusted odds ratios (ORs [95% CIs]) of extremely preterm delivery were as follows: BMI 25 to less than 30 (0.21%; OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15-1.37), BMI 30 to less than 35 (0.27%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.39-1.79), BMI 35 to less than 40 (0.35%; OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66-2.45), and BMI of 40 or greater (0.52%; OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.28-3.92). Risk of spontaneous extremely preterm delivery increased with BMI among obese women (BMI>/=30). Risks of medically indicated preterm deliveries increased with BMI among overweight and obese women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In Sweden, maternal overweight and obesity during pregnancy were associated with increased risks of preterm delivery, especially extremely preterm delivery. These associations should be assessed in other populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between overweight and obesity in mothers and preterm birth and low birth weight in singleton pregnancies in developed and developing countries. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase from their inceptions, and reference lists of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including a reference group of women with normal body mass index that assessed the effect of overweight and obesity on two primary outcomes: preterm birth (before 37 weeks) and low birth weight (<2500 g). DATA EXTRACTION: Two assessors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full articles, extracted data using a piloted data collection form, and assessed quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: 84 studies (64 cohort and 20 case-control) were included, totalling 1 095 834 women. Although the overall risk of preterm birth was similar in overweight and obese women and women of normal weight, the risk of induced preterm birth was increased in overweight and obese women (relative risk 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.37). Although overall the risk of having an infant of low birth weight was decreased in overweight and obese women (0.84, 0.75 to 0.95), the decrease was greater in developing countries than in developed countries (0.58, 0.47 to 0.71 v 0.90, 0.79 to 1.01). After accounting for publication bias, the apparent protective effect of overweight and obesity on low birth weight disappeared with the addition of imputed "missing" studies (0.95, 0.85 to 1.07), whereas the risk of preterm birth appeared significantly higher in overweight and obese women (1.24, 1.13 to 1.37). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obese women have increased risks of preterm birth and induced preterm birth and, after accounting for publication bias, appeared to have increased risks of preterm birth overall. The beneficial effects of maternal overweight and obesity on low birth weight were greater in developing countries and disappeared after accounting for publication bias.},

	abstract = {Pairs of first and second births and pairs of second and third births to the same Norwegian mothers were studied to determine the association between interpregnancy interval and birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Use of the pair approach provides one birth which could possibly have been affected by the length of the interval and one birth which could not. The association of interval and birth weight for births which precede an interval is found to be equivalent to that for births which follow an interval. The data on stillbirth are compatible with higher rates at long intervals while the data on neonatal death are consistent with higher rates at short intervals. However, we conclude that manipulation of the interval between pregnancies is unlikely to have any marked, direct, beneficial effect on outcome of pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Using data from the Missouri maternally linked files (1989--1997), the authors examined the association among maternal obesity, obesity subtypes, and spontaneous and medically indicated preterm (<37 weeks) and very preterm (<33 weeks) births in singletons and twins. Adjusted odds ratios were obtained with correction for intracluster correlation. The prevalence of obesity increased by 77% over the study period (ptrend < 0.001). Obese mothers had a lower risk for spontaneous preterm birth, and this was more pronounced among twins (odds ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.75) than singletons (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.87). However, this association was present only among obese women who gained less than 0.69 kg/week for singletons and between 0.23 and 0.69 kg/week for twins. By contrast, obese mothers with singleton gestation had about 50% greater odds of medically indicated preterm (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.39, 1.54) and very preterm (odds ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.34, 1.65) births, and the risk increases with ascending severity of obesity (ptrend < 0.01). For extreme obesity, the risk of medically indicated preterm and very preterm births was almost double that for nonobese women. Similar findings were observed in twins. These data suggest that obesity increases the risk for medically indicated but not spontaneous preterm birth in both singletons and twins.},

In this paper, we use the potential outcomes framework to derive a general class of sensitivity-analysis formulas for outcomes, treatments, and measured and unmeasured confounding variables that may be categorical or continuous. We give results for additive, risk-ratio and odds-ratio scales. We show that these results encompass a number of more specific sensitivity-analysis methods in the statistics and epidemiology literature. The applicability, usefulness, and limits of the bias-adjustment formulas are discussed. We illustrate the sensitivity-analysis techniques that follow from our results by applying them to 3 different studies. The bias formulas are particularly simple and easy to use in settings in which the unmeasured confounding variable is binary with constant effect on the outcome across treatment levels.},

@article{Jaro1995,
	abstract = {Probabilistic linkage technology makes it feasible and efficient to link large public health databases in a statistically justifiable manner. The problem addressed by the methodology is that of matching two files of individual data under conditions of uncertainty. Each field is subject to error which is measured by the probability that the field agrees given a record pair matches (called the m probability) and probabilities of chance agreement of its value states (called the u probability). Fellegi and Sunter pioneered record linkage theory. Advances in methodology include use of an EM algorithm for parameter estimation, optimization of matches by means of a linear sum assignment program, and more recently, a probability model that addresses both m and u probabilities for all value states of a field. This provides a means for obtaining greater precision from non-uniformly distributed fields, without the theoretical complications arising from frequency-based matching alone. The model includes an iterative parameter estimation procedure that is more robust than pre-match estimation techniques. The methodology was originally developed and tested by the author at the U.S. Census Bureau for census undercount estimation. The more recent advances and a new generalized software system were tested and validated by linking highway crashes to Emergency Medical Service (EMS) reports and to hospital admission records for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computerized record linkage is commonly used in cohort studies to ascertain the study outcome, and as such its accuracy classifying the outcome can be described using the standard epidemiological terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). METHOD: We describe a 'duplicate method' to calculate the PPV of record linkage when each record can only be involved in one match (e.g. linking population files to death files). The method does not require a validation subset of records from both files with detailed personal information (e.g. name and address), and is therefore ideal for linkage projects using anonymous data. The duplicate method assumes that the number of records from one file with zero, one, two, etc., links from the other file is distributed in a manner predicted by combinatorial probabilities. Having made this assumption, the number of false positive links, and hence the PPV, are estimable. We demonstrate this duplicate method using output from anonymous and probabilistic record linkage of census and mortality records in New Zealand. RESULTS: The PPV estimates conform to the pattern expected based on the underlying theory of probabilistic record linkage, and were robust to sensitivity analyses. We encourage other researchers to further assess the accuracy of this method.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if a change in the vaginal flora was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, and to determine if metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks increased the risk of preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: We compared cultures taken at 23 to 26 weeks of gestation with cultures taken at delivery from women enrolled in the Vaginal Infections and Preterm Birth study to analyze the association of changes in the vaginal flora with preterm birth. RESULTS: Metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.05-2.1) in an unadjusted model. A change to heavy growth of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae at delivery was found to be associated with preterm birth (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.6-3.8). After controlling for race, parity, prepregnancy weight <100 pounds, smoking or drinking during pregnancy, Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, mycoplasmas, group B streptococcus, metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks, vaginal pH >5.0, and an increase in E coli or K pneumoniae , only prepregnancy weight <100 pounds (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.07, 95%CI 1.01-4.21) and increased E coli or K pneumoniae in the vagina at delivery (AOR 2.99, 95%CI 1.37-6.53) were found to be significantly associated with preterm birth. CONCLUSION: An increase in E coli or K pneumoniae in the vagina is an independent risk factor for preterm birth. Changes in the vaginal flora may explain the increased risk of preterm birth seen with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole therapy.},

	abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and across the globe. Infection and associated inflammation are important initiators for PTB pathways; an estimated 40% of PTBs are attributed to amniochorionic-decidual or systemic inflammation. Historically, intrauterine infections have been implicated in PTB; recent evidence suggests that infections remote from the fetal site may also be causative. There is strong epidemiological evidence that bacterial vaginosis and periodontitis--two syndromes characterized by perturbations in the normal vaginal and oral bacterial microflora, respectively--are linked to infection-associated PTB. Oral and vaginal environments are similar in their bacterial microbiology; identical bacterial species have been independently isolated in periodontitis and bacterial vaginosis. Periodontitis and bacterial vaginosis also share many behavioral and sociodemographic risk factors suggesting a possible common pathophysiology. Genetic polymorphisms in host inflammatory responses to infection are shared between bacterial vaginosis, periodontitis and PTB, suggesting common mechanisms through which host genotype modify the effect of abnormal bacterial colonization on preterm birth. We review the state of knowledge regarding the risk of PTB attributable to perturbations in bacterial flora in oral and vaginal sites and the role of host genetics in modifying the risk of infection-related PTB. We posit that bacterial species that are common in perturbed vaginal and oral sites are associated with PTB through their interaction with the host immune system.},

	abstract = {The means by which vaginal microbiomes help prevent urogenital diseases in women and maintain health are poorly understood. To gain insight into this, the vaginal bacterial communities of 396 asymptomatic North American women who represented four ethnic groups (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian) were sampled and the species composition characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. The communities clustered into five groups: four were dominated by Lactobacillus iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii, whereas the fifth had lower proportions of lactic acid bacteria and higher proportions of strictly anaerobic organisms, indicating that a potential key ecological function, the production of lactic acid, seems to be conserved in all communities. The proportions of each community group varied among the four ethnic groups, and these differences were statistically significant [chi(2)(10) = 36.8, P < 0.0001]. Moreover, the vaginal pH of women in different ethnic groups also differed and was higher in Hispanic (pH 5.0 +/- 0.59) and black (pH 4.7 +/- 1.04) women as compared with Asian (pH 4.4 +/- 0.59) and white (pH 4.2 +/- 0.3) women. Phylotypes with correlated relative abundances were found in all communities, and these patterns were associated with either high or low Nugent scores, which are used as a factor for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. The inherent differences within and between women in different ethnic groups strongly argues for a more refined definition of the kinds of bacterial communities normally found in healthy women and the need to appreciate differences between individuals so they can be taken into account in risk assessment and disease diagnosis.},

Using a community ordination analysis, we observed infrequent co-occurrence of Mycoplasma and bacteria vaginosis associated bacteria 3 (BVAB3) among black and Hispanic participants. In addition, we found that the vaginal bacteria responded differently in different racial/ethnic groups to modifications of maternal behavioral (ie, douching and smoking) and biological traits (ie, body mass index [BMI]). Even after accounting for these maternal behaviors and traits, the selected vaginal bacteria was significantly associated with preterm birth among black and Hispanic participants. By contrast, white participants did not exhibit significant correlation between microbial community and birth outcome. Findings from this study affirm the necessity of considering women's race/ethnicity when evaluating the correlation between vaginal bacteria and preterm birth.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose was to compare the two different measures of gestational age currently used on birth certificates (the duration of pregnancy based on the date of last menstrual period [LMP] and the clinical estimate [CE] as related to health status indicators. We contrasted these measures by race/ethnicity. METHODS: NCHS natality files for 2000-2002 were used, selecting cases of single live birth to U.S. resident mothers with both LMP and CE gestational age information. RESULTS: Approximately 75% of the records had valid LMP and CE values and for approximately one-half of these, the LMP and CE values did not exactly agree. Overall and for each race and ethnic group, the LMP measures resulted in higher proportions of very preterm, preterm, postterm and SGA births. CE value provided preterm rates of 7.9% and for LMP, 9.9%. The odds ratio of preterm birth for African-Americans using the CE measure was 1.78 [95% Cl 1.77-1.79]. The odds ratio using LMP was 1.93 [95% Cl 1.92-1.94]. Whites were the referent population. CONCLUSIONS: Different measures of gestational age result in different overall and race-specific rates of very preterm, preterm, postterm, and SGA births. These findings indicate that substituting or combining these measures may have consequences.},

@article{Dietz2007,
	abstract = {Although early ultrasound (<20 weeks' gestation) systematically underestimates the gestational age of smaller fetuses by approximately 1-2 days, this bias is relatively small compared with the large error introduced by last menstrual period (LMP) estimates of gestation, as evidenced by the number of implausible birthweight-for-gestational age. To characterise this misclassification, we compared gestational age estimates based on LMP from California birth certificates with those based on early ultrasound from a California linked Statewide Expanded Alpha-fetoprotein Screening Program (XAFP). The final sample comprised 165 908 women. Birthweight distributions were plotted by gestational age; sensitivity and positive predictive value for preterm rates according to LMP were calculated using ultrasound as the 'gold standard'. For gestational ages 20-27 and 28-31 weeks, the LMP-based birthweight distributions were bimodal, whereas the ultrasound-based distributions were unimodal, but had long right tails. At 32-36 weeks, the LMP distribution was wider, flatter, and shifted to the right, compared with the ultrasound distribution. LMP vs. ultrasound estimates were, respectively, 8.7% vs. 7.9% preterm (<37 weeks), 81.2% vs. 91.0% term (37-41 weeks), and 10.1% vs. 1.1% post-term (>or=42 weeks). The sensitivity of the LMP-based preterm birth estimate was 64.3%, and the positive predictive value was 58.7%. Overall, 17.2% of the records had estimates with an absolute difference of >14 days. The groups most likely to have inconsistent gestational age estimates included African American and Hispanic women, younger and less-educated women, and those who entered prenatal care after the second month of pregnancy. In conclusion, we found substantial misclassification of LMP-based gestational age. The 2003 revised US Standard Certificate of Live Birth includes a new gestational age item, the obstetric estimate. It will be important to assess whether this estimate addresses the problems presented by LMP-based gestational age.},

@article{Bodnar2014a,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies using vital records-based maternal weight data have become more common, but the validity of these data is uncertain. METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) reported on birth certificates using medical record data in 1204 births at a teaching hospital in Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2010. Deliveries at this hospital were representative of births statewide with respect to BMI, GWG, race/ethnicity, and preterm birth. Forty-eight strata were created by simultaneous stratification on prepregnancy BMI (underweight, normal weight/overweight, obese class 1, obese classes 2 and 3), GWG (<20th, 20-80th, >80th percentile), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black), and gestational age (term, preterm). RESULTS: The agreement of birth certificate-derived prepregnancy BMI category with medical record BMI category was highest in the normal weight/overweight and obese class 2 and 3 groups. Agreement varied from 52% to 100% across racial/ethnic and gestational age strata. GWG category from the birth registry agreed with medical records for 41-83% of deliveries, and agreement tended to be the poorest for very low and very high GWG. The misclassification of GWG was driven by errors in reported prepregnancy weight rather than maternal weight at delivery, and its magnitude depended on prepregnancy BMI category and gestational age at delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal weight data, particularly at the extremes, are poorly reported on birth certificates. Investigators should devote resources to well-designed validation studies, the results of which can be used to adjust for measurement errors by bias analysis.},

@article{Lash2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data sets continue to grow larger. Probabilistic-bias analyses, which simulate hundreds of thousands of replications of the original data set, may challenge desktop computational resources. METHODS: We implemented a probabilistic-bias analysis to evaluate the direction, magnitude, and uncertainty of the bias arising from misclassification of prepregnancy body mass index when studying its association with early preterm birth in a cohort of 773,625 singleton births. We compared 3 bias analysis strategies: (1) using the full cohort, (2) using a case-cohort design, and (3) weighting records by their frequency in the full cohort. RESULTS: Underweight and overweight mothers were more likely to deliver early preterm. A validation substudy demonstrated misclassification of prepregnancy body mass index derived from birth certificates. Probabilistic-bias analyses suggested that the association between underweight and early preterm birth was overestimated by the conventional approach, whereas the associations between overweight categories and early preterm birth were underestimated. The 3 bias analyses yielded equivalent results and challenged our typical desktop computing environment. Analyses applied to the full cohort, case cohort, and weighted full cohort required 7.75 days and 4 terabytes, 15.8 hours and 287 gigabytes, and 8.5 hours and 202 gigabytes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Large epidemiologic data sets often include variables that are imperfectly measured, often because data were collected for other purposes. Probabilistic-bias analysis allows quantification of errors but may be difficult in a desktop computing environment. Solutions that allow these analyses in this environment can be achieved without new hardware and within reasonable computational time frames.},

@article{Othman2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preterm birth causes 60{\%} to 80{\%} of neonatal deaths. Survivors can experience life-long complications. The risk of preterm labour in the presence of maternal infection is thought to be 30% to 50%. Probiotics are defined as live micro-organisms which, when administered in an adequate amount, confer a health benefit on the host. They have been shown to displace and kill pathogens and modulate the immune response by interfering with the inflammatory cascade that leads to preterm labour and delivery. During pregnancy, local treatment restoring normal vaginal flora and acidity without systemic effects could be preferable to other treatment in preventing preterm labour. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of probiotics for preventing preterm labour and birth. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials assessing the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women and women planning pregnancy through the use of probiotics to treat or prevent urogenital infections. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the prepared form and analysed with the Review Manager software. MAIN RESULTS: We assessed four trials for inclusion in the review. One trial started in February 2005 and is still ongoing. We excluded one trial because there were no data to be extracted from the article. Of the two trials included in the review, one enrolled women after 34 weeks of pregnancy using oral fermented milk as probiotic, while the other study utilised commercially available yogurt to be used vaginally by women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy. Reduction in genital infection was the only prespecified clinical outcome for which the data were available; pooled results showed an 81% reduction in the risk of genital infection with the use of probiotics (risk ratio 0.19; 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.48). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of probiotics appears to treat vaginal infections in pregnancy, there are currently insufficient data from trials to assess impact on preterm birth and its complications.},

@article{Thinkhamrop2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that prophylactic antibiotics given during pregnancy improved maternal and perinatal outcomes, while others have shown no benefit and some have reported adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on maternal and perinatal outcomes during the second and third trimester of pregnancy for all women or women at risk of preterm delivery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014) and reference lists of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment for women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy before labour. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: The review included seven randomised controlled trials. Approximately 2100 women were recruited to detect the effect of prophylactic antibiotic administration on pregnancy outcomes. Primary outcomesAntibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (risk ratio (RR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 1.49 (one trial, 229 women) low quality evidence) or preterm delivery (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.14 (five trials, 1480 women) low quality evidence). However, preterm delivery was reduced in the subgroup of pregnant women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis (BV) during the current pregnancy (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88 (one trial, 258 women), but there was no reduction in the subgroup of pregnant women with previous preterm birth without BV during the pregnancy (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.77 (two trials, 500 women)). A reduction in the risk of postpartum endometritis (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.92 (one trial, 196 women)) was observed in high-risk pregnant women (women with a history of preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth or early perinatal death) and in all women (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.82 (three trials, 627 women) moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in low birth weight (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39 (four trials; 978 women) or neonatal sepsis (RR 11.31; 95% CI 0.64 to 200.79); and blood culture confirming sepsis was not reported in any of the studies. Secondary outcomesAntibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78 (one trial, 229 women) low quality evidence) and gonococcal infection (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.94 (one trial, 204 women)). There were no differences observed in other secondary outcomes (congenital abnormality; small-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality), whilst many other secondary outcomes (e.g. intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics) were not reported in included trials.Regarding the route of antibiotic administration, vaginal antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy did not prevent infectious pregnancy outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low except that incomplete outcome data produced high risk of bias in some studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was assessed as low for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, low for preterm delivery, moderate for postpartum endometritis, low for prelabour rupture of membranes, and very low for chorioamnionitis. Intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics was not reported in any of the included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or preterm delivery (apart from in the subgroup of women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis). Antibiotic prophylaxis given during the second or third trimester of pregnancy reduced the risk of postpartum endometritis, preterm rupture of membranes and gonococcal infection when given routinely to all pregnant women. Substantial bias possibly exists in the review's results because of a high rate of loss to follow-up and the small numbers of studies included in each of our analyses. There is also insufficient evidence on possible harmful effects on the baby. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of routine antibiotics during pregnancy to prevent infectious adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes.},

@article{Andrews2006,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that upper genital tract microbial infection associated with spontaneous preterm birth may precede conception. Our objective was to estimate if antibiotic administration during the interpregnancy interval in nonpregnant women with a previous preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestational age would reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in the subsequent pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Women with a spontaneous preterm birth < 34 weeks' gestational age were randomized at 4 months' postpartum to receive oral azithromycin 1 g twice (4 days apart) plus sustained-release metronidazole 750 mg daily for 7 days, or identical-appearing placebos. This regimen was repeated every 4 months until the subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 241 women were randomized; 124 conceived a subsequent pregnancy and were available for study, including 59 in the antibiotic group and 65 in the placebo group. In the antibiotic versus placebo group, neither subsequent spontaneous preterm birth (< 37 weeks: 52% vs 46%, P = .568; < 35 weeks: 40% vs 30%, P = .276; < 32 weeks: 31% vs 23%, P = .376) nor miscarriage (< 15 weeks: 12% vs 14%, P = .742) was significantly different. Although not statistically significant, mean delivery gestational age in the subsequent pregnancy was 2.4 weeks earlier in the antibiotic versus placebo group (32.0 +/- 7.9 vs 34.4 +/- 6.3 weeks, P = .082), and mean birth weight was lower in the antibiotic group (2046 +/- 1209 vs 2464 +/- 1067 g, P =.060). CONCLUSION: Intermittent treatment with metronidazole plus azithromycin of nonpregnant women with a recent early spontaneous preterm birth does not significantly reduce subsequent preterm birth, and may be associated with a lower delivery gestational age and lower birth weight.},

	abstract = {This article uses survey data to investigate health effects of racialization in Canada. The operative sample was comprised of 91,123 Canadians aged 25 and older who completed the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey. A "racial and cultural background" survey question contributed a variable that differentiated respondents who identified with Aboriginal, Black, Chinese, Filipino, Latin American, South Asian, White, or jointly Aboriginal and White racial/cultural backgrounds. Indicators of diabetes, hypertension and self-rated health were used to assess health. The healthy immigrant effect suppressed some disparity in risk for diabetes by racial/cultural identification. In logistic regression models also containing gender, age, and immigrant status, no racial/cultural identifications corresponded with significantly better health outcomes than those reported by survey respondents identifying as White. Subsequent models indicated that residential locale did little to explain the associations between racial/cultural background and health and that socioeconomic status was only implicated in relatively poor health outcomes for respondents identifying as Aboriginal or Aboriginal/White. Sizable and statistically significant relative risks for poor health for respondents identifying as Aboriginal, Aboriginal/White, Black, Chinese, or South Asian remained unexplained by the models, suggesting that other explanations for health disparities by racialized identity in Canada - perhaps pertaining to experiences with institutional racism and/or the wear and tear of experiences of racism and discrimination in everyday life - also deserve empirical investigation in this context.},

@article{Hystad2013,
	abstract = {Neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with numerous chronic diseases, yet little information exists on its association with lung cancer incidence. This outcome presents two key empirical challenges: a long latency period that requires study participants' residential histories and long-term neighbourhood characteristics; and adequate data on many risk factors to test hypothesized mediating pathways between neighbourhood SES and lung cancer incidence. Analysing data on urban participants of a large Canadian population-based lung cancer case-control study, we investigate three issues pertaining to these challenges. First, we examine whether there is an association between long-term neighbourhood SES, derived from 20 years of residential histories and five national censuses, and lung cancer incidence. Second, we determine how this long-term neighbourhood SES association changes when using neighbourhood SES measures based on different latency periods or at time of study entry. Third, we estimate the extent to which long-term neighbourhood SES is mediated by a range of individual-level smoking behaviours, other health behaviours, and environmental and occupational exposures. Results of hierarchical logistic regression models indicate significantly higher odds of lung cancer cases residing in the most compared to the least deprived quintile of the long-term neighbourhood SES index (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13-1.89) after adjustment for individual SES. This association remained significant (OR: 1.38; 1.01-1.88) after adjusting for smoking behaviour and other known and suspected lung cancer risk factors. Important differences were observed between long-term and study entry neighbourhood SES measures, with the latter attenuating effect estimates by over 50 percent. Smoking behaviour was the strongest partial mediating pathway of the long-term neighbourhood SES effect. This research is the first to examine the effects of long-term neighbourhood SES on lung cancer risk and more research is needed to further identify specific, modifiable pathways by which neighbourhood context may influence lung cancer risk.},

@article{Williams2008a,
	abstract = {There is considerable scientific and policy interest in reducing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare and health status. Currently, much of the policy focus around reducing health disparities has been geared toward improving access, coverage, quality, and the intensity of healthcare. However, health is more a function of lifestyles linked to living and working conditions than of healthcare. Accordingly, effective efforts to improve health and reduce gaps in health need to pay greater attention to addressing the social determinants of health within and outside of the healthcare system. This article highlights research evidence documenting that tackling the social determinants of health can lead to reductions in health disparities. It focuses both on interventions within the healthcare system that address some of the social determinants of health and on interventions in upstream factors such as housing, neighborhood conditions, and increased socioeconomic status that can lead to improvements in health. The studies reviewed highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of social and economic policies that might have health consequences and the need for policy makers, healthcare providers, and leaders across multiple sectors of society to apply currently available knowledge to improve the underlying conditions that impact the health of populations.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the associations between lower genital tract infection, racial group and preterm birth in the Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study, a large prospective cohort study conducted between 1984 and 1989. This analysis included 11 910 women enrolled at 23-26 weeks' gestation with equal representation from self-identified African American, Hispanic and white women. Subjects were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis at study entry, and their pregnancy outcomes were ascertained after delivery. The primary outcome of interest was preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant (<37 weeks and <2500 g). The associations between lower genital tract infection and preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant were examined within each racial group, with adjustment for potential confounders using multivariable logistic regression. In this cohort, 6.4% of African Americans, 3.8% of Hispanics, and 4.4% of whites had a preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant (P < 0.001). Lower genital tract infection was significantly associated with preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant among African Americans, but not among other racial groups. The proportion of preterm birth associated with lower genital tract infection was 21% among African Americans and 5% among whites. The increase in infection-associated preterm birth among African Americans appears to be related both to an increased prevalence of lower genital tract infection, and also to an increased risk of preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant in the context of lower genital tract infection.},

@article{Flenady2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aetiology of preterm birth is complex and there is evidence that subclinical genital tract infection influences preterm labour in some women but the role of prophylactic antibiotic treatment in the management of preterm labour is controversial. Since rupture of the membranes is an important factor in the progression of preterm labour, it is important to see if the routine administration of antibiotics confers any benefit or causes harm, prior to membrane rupture. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of prophylactic antibiotics administered to women in preterm labour with intact membranes, on maternal and neonatal outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that compared antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment for women in preterm labour (between 20 and 36 weeks' gestation) with intact membranes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, and undertook quality assessment and data extraction. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results are presented using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) was calculated where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: In this update (2013), with the addition of three trials (305 women), the large ORACLE II 2001 trial continues to dominate the results of this review. This review now includes a total of 14 studies randomising 7837 women. No significant difference was shown in perinatal or infant mortality for infants of women allocated to any prophylactic antibiotics compared with no antibiotics. However, an increase in neonatal deaths was shown for infants of women receiving any prophylactic antibiotics when compared with placebo (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.40; NNTH 149, 95% CI 2500 to 61). No reduction in preterm birth or other clinically important short-term outcomes for the infant were shown.Long-term child outcomes to seven years of age were available for infants in the UK enrolled in the ORACLE II trial. Comparing any antibiotics with placebo, a marginally non-statistically significant increase was shown in any functional impairment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23) and cerebral palsy (CP) (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.34). In subgroup analysis, CP was statistically significantly increased for infants of women allocated to macrolide and beta-lactam antibiotics combined compared with placebo (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.02 to 7.88; NNTH 35, 95% CI 333 to 9).Further, exposure to any macrolide antibiotics (including erythromycin alone or erythromycin plus co-amoxiclav) versus no macrolide antibiotics (including placebo and co-amoxiclav alone) was shown to increase neonatal death (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.19; NNTH 139, 95% CI 1429 to 61), any functional impairment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; NNTH 24, 95% CI 263 to 13) and CP (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.01; NNTH 64, 95% CI 286 to 29). Exposure to any beta-lactam (beta-lactam alone or in combination with macrolide antibiotics) versus no beta-lactam antibiotics resulted in more neonatal deaths (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.15; NNTH 143, 95% CI 1250 to 63) and CP (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.61; NNTH 79, 95% CI 909 to 33), however no difference was shown in functional impairment.Maternal infection was reduced with the use of any prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86; NNTB 34, 95% CI 24 to 63) and any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92; NNTB 47, 95% CI 31 to 119). However, caution should be exercised with this finding due to the possibility of bias shown by funnel plot asymmetry. Any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics was associated with an increase in maternal adverse drug reaction (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.54; NNTH 17, 95% CI 526 to 7). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review did not demonstrate any benefit in important neonatal outcomes with the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, although maternal infection may be reduced. Of concern, is the finding of short- and longer-term harm for children of mothers exposed to antibiotics. The evidence supports not giving antibiotics routinely to women in preterm labour with intact membranes in the absence of overt signs of infection.Further research is required to develop sensitive markers of subclinical infection for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, as this is a group that might benefit from future novel interventions, including new modalities of antibiotic therapy. The results of this review demonstrate the need for future trials in the area of preterm birth to include assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.},

	abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate $t$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

	abstract = {Maternal and associated neonatal mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa remain unacceptably high. In Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda), 2 major causes of maternal death are preeclampsia and obstructed labor and their complications, conditions occurring at the extremes of the birthweight spectrum, a situation encapsulated as the obstetric dilemma. We have questioned whether the prevalence of these disorders occurs more frequently in indigenous African women and those with African ancestry elsewhere in the world by reviewing available literature. We conclude that these women are at greater risk of preeclampsia than other racial groups. At least part of this susceptibility seems independent of socioeconomic status and likely is due to biological or genetic factors. Evidence for a genetic contribution to preeclampsia is discussed. We go on to propose that the obstetric dilemma in humans is responsible for this situation and discuss how parturition and birthweight are subject to stabilizing selection. Other data we present also suggest that there are particularly strong evolutionary selective pressures operating during pregnancy and delivery in Africans. There is much greater genetic diversity and less linkage disequilibrium in Africa, and the genes responsible for regulating birthweight and placentation may therefore be easier to define than in non-African cohorts. Inclusion of African women into research on preeclampsia is an essential component in tackling this major disparity of maternal health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A common epidemiologic objective is to evaluate the contribution of residential context to individual-level disparities by race or socioeconomic position. PURPOSE: We reviewed analytic strategies to account for the total (observed and unobserved factors) contribution of environmental context to health inequalities, including conventional fixed effects (FE) and hybrid FE implemented within a random effects (RE) or a marginal model. METHODS: To illustrate results and limitations of the various analytic approaches of accounting for the total contextual component of health disparities, we used data on births nested within neighborhoods as an applied example of evaluating neighborhood confounding of racial disparities in gestational age at birth, including both a continuous and a binary outcome. RESULTS: Ordinary and RE models provided disparity estimates that can be substantially biased in the presence of neighborhood confounding. Both FE and hybrid FE models can account for cluster level confounding and provide disparity estimates unconfounded by neighborhood, with the latter having greater flexibility in allowing estimation of neighborhood-level effects and intercept/slope variability when implemented in a RE specification. CONCLUSIONS: Given the range of models that can be implemented in a hybrid approach and the frequent goal of accounting for contextual confounding, this approach should be used more often.},

The review focused on the following clinical conditions: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, asthma, major depressive disorder, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pregnancy, and end-stage renal disease. It assessed health disparities associated with race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance status, sexual orientation, health literacy/numeracy, and language barrier. We evaluated the risk of bias of individual studies and the overall strength of the body of evidence based on risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision. RESULTS: Nineteen papers, representing 14 primary research studies, met criteria for inclusion. All but one of the studies incorporated multiple components into their QI approach. Patient education was part of most interventions (12 of 14), although the specific approach differed substantially across the studies. Ten of the studies incorporated self-management; this would include, for example, teaching individuals with diabetes to check their blood sugar regularly. Most (8 of 14) included some sort of provider education, which may have focused on the clinical issue or on raising awareness about disparities affecting the target population. Studies evaluated the effect of these strategies on disparities in the prevention or treatment of breast or colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, or diabetes. Overall, QI interventions were not shown to reduce disparities. Most studies have focused on racial or ethnic disparities, with some targeted interventions demonstrating greater effect in racial minorities--specifically, supporting individuals in tracking their blood pressure at home to reduce blood pressure and collaborative care to improve depression care. In one study, the effect of a language-concordant breast cancer screening intervention was helpful in promoting mammography in Spanish-speaking women. For some depression care outcomes, the collaborative care model was more effective in less-educated individuals than in those with more education and in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on QI interventions generally and their ability to improve health and health care is large. Whether those interventions are effective at reducing disparities remains unclear. This report should not be construed to assess the general effectiveness of QI in the health care setting; rather, QI has not been shown specifically to reduce known disparities in health care or health outcomes. In a few instances, some increased effect is seen in disadvantaged populations; these studies should be replicated and the interventions studied further as having potential to address disparities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To give an overview of the literature for evidence of nutrient deficiencies as contributors to the disparity in preterm birth (PTB) between African-American and Caucasian women. DESIGN: Structured literature survey. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE to identify observational and experimental studies that evaluated the relation between nutrient intake and/or supplementation and PTB. For nutrients for which studies supported an association, we searched MEDLINE for studies of the prevalence of deficiency in the USA by race. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Summarized findings on nutrients for which there is both evidence of a role in PTB and variability in the prevalence of deficiency by race. RESULTS: Nutrient deficiencies for which there are varying levels of evidence for an association with PTB and a greater burden among African-American compared with Caucasian women include deficiencies of iron, folic acid, zinc, vitamin D, calcium and magnesium, and imbalance of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. There are inadequate high-quality studies that investigate the role of nutrient deficiencies in PTB, their potential interaction with other risks, the proportion of excess risk for which they account, and whether supplementation can reduce the risk of, and racial disparities in, PTB in US populations. CONCLUSION: Deficiencies of several nutrients have varying levels of evidence of association with PTB and are of greater burden among African-American compared with Caucasian women. Although further research is needed, strategies that improve the nutritional status of African-American women may be a means of addressing a portion of the racial disparity in PTB.},

In 2005, the stillbirth rate (fetal deaths >/= 20 weeks' gestation per 1000 fetal deaths and live births) for non-Hispanic blacks was 11.13 compared with 4.79 for non-Hispanic whites. Rates were intermediate for American Indian or Alaska Natives (6.17) and Hispanics (5.44). There is racial disparity for both early (< 28 weeks' gestation) and late stillbirths. We review available data regarding risk factors for stillbirth with a focus on those factors that are more prevalent in certain racial/ethnic groups and those factors that appear to have a more profound effect in certain racial/ethnic groups. Although many factors, including genetics, environment, stress, social issues, access to and quality of medical care and behavior, contribute to racial disparity in stillbirth, the reasons for the disparity remain unclear. Knowledge gaps and recommendations for further research and interventions intended to reduce racial disparity in stillbirth are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality in the United States seem to defy all attempts at elimination. Despite national priorities to eliminate these disparities, black infants are 2.5 times more likely to die in infancy compared with non-Hispanic white infants. This disparity is largely related to the greater incidence among black infants of prematurity and low birth weight, congenital malformations, sudden infant death syndrome, and unintentional injuries. This greater incidence, in turn, is related to a complex interaction of behavioral, social, political, genetic, medical, and health care access factors. Thus, to influence the persistent racial disparity in infant mortality, a highly integrated approach is needed, with interventions adapted along a continuum from childhood through the periods of young adulthood, pregnancy, postpartum and beyond. The content and methodologies of these interventions need to be adapted to the underlying behaviors, social influences, and technology and access issues they are meant to address.},

	abstract = {Infection has been hypothesized to be one of the factors associated with spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and with the racial disparity in rates of PTB between African American and Caucasian women. However, recent findings refute the generalizability of the role of infection and inflammation. African Americans have an increased incidence of PTB in the setting of intraamniotic infection, periodontal disease, and bacterial vaginosis compared to Caucasians. Herein we report variability in infection- and inflammation-related factors based on race/ethnicity. For African American women, an imbalance in the host proinflammatory response seems to contribute to infection-associated PTB, as evidenced by a greater presence of inflammatory mediators with limited or reduced presence of immune balancing factors. This may be attributed to differences in the genetic variants associated with PTB between African Americans and Caucasians. We argue that infection may not be a cause of racial disparity but in association with other risk factors such as stress, nutritional deficiency, and differences in genetic variations in PTB, pathways and their complex interactions may produce differential inflammatory responses that may contribute to racial disparity.},

@article{Kramer2011,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the evidence for three theories of how preconceptional psychosocial stress could act as a contributing determinant of excess preterm birth risk among African American women: early life developmental plasticity and epigenetic programming of adult neuroendocrine systems; blunting, weathering, or dysfunction of neuroendocrine and immune function in response to chronic stress activation through the life course; individuals' adoption of risky behaviors such as smoking as a response to stressful stimuli. METHODS: Basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic studies indexed in MEDLINE and Web of Science databases on preconceptional psychosocial stress, preterm birth and race were reviewed. RESULTS: Mixed evidence leans towards modest associations between preconceptional chronic stress and preterm birth (for example common odds ratios of 1.2-1.4), particularly in African American women, but it is unclear whether this association is causal or explains a substantial portion of the Black-White racial disparity in preterm birth. The stress-preterm birth association may be mediated by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis, although these mechanisms are incompletely understood. Evidence for the role of epigenetic or early life programming as a determinant of racial disparities in preterm birth risk is more circumstantial. CONCLUSIONS: Preconceptional stress, directly or in interaction with host genetic susceptibility or infection, remains an important hypothesized risk factor for understanding and reducing racial disparities in preterm birth. Future studies that integrate adequately sized epidemiologic samples with measures of stress, infection, and gene expression, will advance our knowledge and allow development of targeted interventions.},

African-American women have a 2-fold to 3-fold elevated risk compared with non-Hispanic white women for reasons that are incompletely understood. This paper reviews the evidence for the biologic and social patterning of very preterm birth, with attention to leading hypotheses regarding the etiology of the racial disparity. A systematic review of the literature in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EMBASE indices was conducted. The literature to date suggests a complex, multifactorial causal framework for understanding racial disparities in very preterm birth, with maternal inflammatory, vascular, or neuroendocrine dysfunction as proximal pathways and maternal exposure to stress, racial differences in preconceptional health, and genetic, epigenetic, and gene-environment interactions as more distal mediators. Interpersonal and institutionalized racism are mechanisms that may drive racially patterned differences. Current literature is limited in that research on social determinants and biologic processes of prematurity has been generally disconnected. Improved etiologic understanding and the potential for effective intervention may come with better integration of these research approaches.},

@article{Kuzawa2009,
	abstract = {The relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to the US black-white disparity in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is hotly debated within the public health, anthropology, and medical communities. In this article, we review evidence for developmental and epigenetic pathways linking early life environments with CVD, and critically evaluate their possible role in the origins of these racial health disparities. African Americans not only suffer from a disproportionate burden of CVD relative to whites, but also have higher rates of the perinatal health disparities now known to be the antecedents of these conditions. There is extensive evidence for a social origin to prematurity and low birth weight in African Americans, reflecting pathways such as the effects of discrimination on maternal stress physiology. In light of the inverse relationship between birth weight and adult CVD, there is now a strong rationale to consider developmental and epigenetic mechanisms as links between early life environmental factors like maternal stress during pregnancy and adult race-based health disparities in diseases like hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary heart disease. The model outlined here builds upon social constructivist perspectives to highlight an important set of mechanisms by which social influences can become embodied, having durable and even transgenerational influences on the most pressing US health disparities. We conclude that environmentally responsive phenotypic plasticity, in combination with the better-studied acute and chronic effects of social-environmental exposures, provides a more parsimonious explanation than genetics for the persistence of CVD disparities between members of socially imposed racial categories.},

	abstract = {Preterm labor leading to preterm delivery (<37 weeks' gestation) affects approximately 5-7% of live births in developed countries, but significantly higher in developing countries. Prematurity due to preterm birth (PTB) accounts for around 28% of neonatal mortality worldwide. Approximately 45-50% of PTBs are idiopathic or spontaneous, 30% are related to preterm rupture of membranes, and another 15-20% are attributed to medically indicated or elective preterm deliveries. The rate of spontaneous PTB is also increasing and the exact cause is still unclear. Generalized approaches in screening for high risk status of preterm labor and interventions have failed to reduce PTB rates. PTB presents a clinical dilemma due to etiologic, pathophysiologic and genetic heterogeneities. Racial disparity in PTB rates observed in the US further complicates its understanding. PTB is a complex phenotype and is not initiated by a single etiologic agent. Etiologic factors operate through multiple pathophysiologic pathways, and these pathways include highly overlapping biomarkers and molecular factors creating pathophysiologic heterogeneities. In this article, the current understanding of PTB pathophysiology is reviewed and the need for a much broader approach in research, analysis and interpretation of data is explained, where environmental and race/ethnicity specific risk factors may dictate specific pathways leading to PTB. Recent data on amniotic fluid biomarkers and maternal and fetal genetic variants, which indicate huge disparity between races in the US, are also reviewed. These data suggest that gene-gene interactions and gene-environmental interactions produce distinct pathophysiologic pathways with respect to an individual's genetic make-up and environmental risk exposure. Current strategies of high risk screening and intervention measures may not be generalized, and a more individualized approach may be required to understand PTB and its prevention.},

The review focused on potential contributing pathophysiological factors to infant and maternal mortality. RESULTS: Racial disparities in neonatal mortality largely result from excess rates of preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal sepsis while racial disparities in maternal mortality reflect greater prevalence and/or severity of cardiovascular/preeclamptic complications, hemorrhage, and infection among African American women. A large body of epidemiological, placental, and pathophysiological evidence suggests that racial disparities in these disparate outcomes result from two distinct, but potentially converging, pathways: infection and vascular. Racial disparities in intrauterine infection and microvascular dysfunction during pregnancy may result from a constellation of environmental and intergenerational risk factors including psychosocial stress, douching, bottle-feeding, lead exposure, diet, intrauterine growth, and genes. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in infant and maternal mortality appear to reflect a confluence of infections and microvascular dysfunction during pregnancy among African American women. Interventions that target these conditions offer promise for reducing racial disparities in these critical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Supplementation with multiple micronutrients (MM) during pregnancy may result in improved pregnancy and infant outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of prenatal supplementation with MM (defined as containing at least five micronutrients and typically included iron or iron and folic acid). The outcomes of interest were low birthweight (<2500 g), birthweight, small-for-gestational age (SGA), gestational age, preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation), stillbirth and neonatal death, maternal morbidity and mortality. We identified eligible studies through PubMed and EMBASE database searches. Meta-analyses were performed by pooling results for outcomes that were reported from more than one trial and sub-analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of timing of intervention and amount of iron. We included published results from 16 trials in this review. Compared with control supplementation that was usually iron plus folic acid in most studies, MM supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of low birthweight [pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81, 0.91] and SGA (pooled RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73, 0.95]) and an increase in mean birthweight (weighted mean difference (WMD) 52.6 g [95% CI 43.2 g, 62.0 g]). There was no significant difference in the overall risk of preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal or neonatal mortality, but we found an increased risk of neonatal death for the MM group compared with iron-folate in the subgroup of five trials that began the intervention after the first trimester (RR 1.38 [95% CI 1.05, 1.81]). None of the studies evaluated maternal morbidity. Compared with iron plus folic acid supplementation alone, prenatal maternal supplementation with MM resulted in a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight and SGA but increased risk of neonatal death in the subgroup of studies that began the intervention after the first trimester.},

@article{Imhoff-Kunsch2012,
	abstract = {Evidence from observational studies and randomised trials has suggested a potential association between intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) during pregnancy and certain pregnancy and birth outcomes. Marine foods (e.g. fatty sea fish, algae) and select freshwater fish contain pre-formed n-3 LCPUFA, which serve as precursors for bioactive molecules (e.g. prostaglandins) that influence a variety of biological processes. The main objective of this analysis was to summarise evidence of the effect of n-3 LCPUFA intake during pregnancy on select maternal and child health outcomes. Searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and other electronic databases to identify trials where n-3 LCPUFA were provided to pregnant women for at least one trimester of pregnancy. Data were extracted into a standardised abstraction table and pooled analyses were conducted using RevMan software. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, and 14 observational studies were included in the general review. n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy resulted in a modest increase in birthweight (mean difference = 42.2 g; [95% CI 14.8, 69.7]) and no significant differences in birth length or head circumference. Women receiving n-3 LCPUFA had a 26% lower risk of early preterm delivery (<34 weeks) (RR = 0.74; [95% CI 0.58, 0.94]) and there was a suggestion of decreased risk of preterm delivery (RR = 0.91; [95% CI 0.82, 1.01]) and low birthweight (RR = 0.92; [95% CI 0.83, 1.02]). n-3 LCPUFA in pregnancy did not influence the occurrence of pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure, infant death, or stillbirth. Our review of observational studies revealed mixed findings, with several large studies reporting positive associations between fish intake and birthweight and several reporting no associations. In conclusion, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy resulted in a decreased risk of early preterm delivery and a modest increase in birthweight. More studies in low- and middle-income countries are needed to determine any effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in resource-poor settings, where n-3 PUFA intake is likely low.},

	abstract = {Preterm birth is a syndrome with many causes and phenotypes. We propose a classification that is based on clinical phenotypes that are defined by >/= 1 characteristics of the mother, the fetus, the placenta, the signs of parturition, and the pathway to delivery. Risk factors and mode of delivery are not included. There are 5 components in a preterm birth phenotype: (1) maternal conditions that are present before presentation for delivery, (2) fetal conditions that are present before presentation for delivery, (3) placental pathologic conditions, (4) signs of the initiation of parturition, and (5) the pathway to delivery. This system does not force any preterm birth into a predefined phenotype and allows all relevant conditions to become part of the phenotype. Needed data can be collected from the medical records to classify every preterm birth. The classification system will improve understanding of the cause and improve surveillance across populations.},

These include the use of corticosteroids for fetal maturation and regionalization of perinatal care for high-risk mothers and their infants. Several interventions, including progesterone use and cerclage, demonstrate promise in reducing spontaneous preterm births.

	abstract = {This paper is the first in a three-part series on preterm birth, which is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Infants are born preterm at less than 37 weeks' gestational age after: (1) spontaneous labour with intact membranes, (2) preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), and (3) labour induction or caesarean delivery for maternal or fetal indications. The frequency of preterm births is about 12-13% in the USA and 5-9% in many other developed countries; however, the rate of preterm birth has increased in many locations, predominantly because of increasing indicated preterm births and preterm delivery of artificially conceived multiple pregnancies. Common reasons for indicated preterm births include pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Births that follow spontaneous preterm labour and PPROM-together called spontaneous preterm births-are regarded as a syndrome resulting from multiple causes, including infection or inflammation, vascular disease, and uterine overdistension. Risk factors for spontaneous preterm births include a previous preterm birth, black race, periodontal disease, and low maternal body-mass index. A short cervical length and a raised cervical-vaginal fetal fibronectin concentration are the strongest predictors of spontaneous preterm birth.},

	abstract = {Preterm birth complicates 11{\%} of all pregnancies in the United States and remains a leading cause of infant mortality and long-term neurological handicap. The majority of this morbidity and mortality is concentrated among the small subset of infants born before 32 weeks' gestational age and that have birth weights < 1500 g. Although the survival of these preterm infants has improved over the last 20 years, the rate of long-term handicap has not. Despite widespread use of preventive strategies, the rate of preterm birth is increasing. Therefore, the prevalence of long-term handicap attributed to preterm birth also is increasing. Considerable data implicate a clinically silent upper genital tract infection as a key component of the pathophysiology of a majority of early spontaneous preterm births, but a minority of preterm births that occur near term. This report reviews the current status of our understanding of the relationship between genital tract microbial infection and spontaneous preterm birth, the availability and usefulness of markers to identify women with such infections, and the results of recent prospective randomized clinical trials of antibiotic therapy to prevent preterm birth. Strengths and limitations of the trials are reviewed in relationship to their value for guidance in clinical management strategies and directions for future research are discussed.},

Infants at highest risk are those born weighing < 1000 g and those born at <28 weeks gestation. Recent evidence suggests that the majority of these preterm births are caused by bacterial infections of the chorioamnion, with the organisms originating in the vagina. The mechanisms leading to preterm labor and rupture of membranes involve an inflammatory response involving increased production of cytokines, prostaglandins, and metalloproteases. Results of treatment trials to eradicate the infection and reduce preterm birth have been mixed.},

@article{Andrews1995,
	abstract = {Preterm birth complicates 8-10{\%} of all pregnancies in the United States and is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Neonatal morbidity and mortality is concentrated among very low-birthweight and extremely premature infants, particularly those delivered prior to 30 weeks' gestational age. In addition to the contribution of preterm birth to neonatal morbidity and mortality, the economic costs associated with this pregnancy complication are staggering. Efforts to reduce the preterm birth rate have been largely focused on prevention and early intervention with treatment for preterm labor. Mixed results regarding the success of prematurity prevention programs have been reported, and controversy continues to surround the efficacy of tocolytic therapy in the treatment of preterm labor. Although neonatal survival for infants born at early gestational ages has steadily improved in recent years, survival of infants delivered prior to 24 weeks' gestation remains very poor. Additionally, despite this decline in neonatal mortality, the United States still lags behind most industrialized nations in infant mortality, and no change in the rate of low birthweight has occurred in recent decades. Multiple lines of evidence support a role for infection as an etiologic factor in preterm labor. Although this association has been well known for many years, a wealth of new data is emerging, linking subclinical genital tract infection with spontaneous preterm birth, particularly among pregnancies that result in birth prior to 30 weeks' gestational age as a result of spontaneous preterm labor or preterm, premature rupture of membranes. Conversely, preterm birth that occurs closer to term is less likely to be associated with genital tract infection. Improved understanding of the link between genital tract infection and preterm birth now provides an exciting potential for the development of sensitive new markers to identify women at risk and effective interventions to prevent preterm birth. A review and comment on this growing literature is provided.},

Burdens from PTB are especially severe for the very preterm infant (<32 weeks' gestation), comprising 2% of all US births. Successful prevention needs to include newly focused and adequately funded research, incorporating new technologies and recognition that genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors interact in complex pathogeneses and multiple pathways leading to PTB. The March of Dimes Scientific Advisory Committee created this prioritized research agenda, which is aimed at garnering serious attention and expanding resources to make major inroads into the prevention of PTB, targeting six major, overlapping categories: epidemiology, genetics, disparities, inflammation, biologic stress, and clinical trials. Analogous to other common, complex disorders, progress in prevention will require incorporating multipronged risk reduction strategies that are based on sound scientific discovery, as well as on effective translation into clinical care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Findings from studies examining risk of preterm birth associated with elevated prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) have been inconsistent. METHODS: Within a large population-based cohort, we explored associations between prepregnancy BMI and spontaneous preterm birth across a spectrum of BMI, gestational age, and racial/ethnic categories. We analysed data for 989,687 singleton births in California, 2007-09. Preterm birth was grouped as 20-23, 24-27, 28-31, or 32-36 weeks gestation (compared with 37-41 weeks). BMI was categorised as <18.5 (underweight); 18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); 30.0-34.9 (obese I); 35.0-39.9 (obese II); and >/= 40.0 (obese III). We assessed associations between BMI and spontaneous preterm birth of varying severity among non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black women. RESULTS: Analyses of mothers without hypertension and diabetes, adjusted for age, education, height, and prenatal care initiation, showed obesity categories I-III to be associated with increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth at 20-23 and 24-27 weeks among those of parity 1 in each race/ethnic group. Relative risks for obese III and preterm birth at 20-23 weeks were 6.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.06, 12.9], 4.34 [95% CI 2.30, 8.16], and 4.45 [95% CI 2.53, 7.82] for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics, respectively. A similar, but lower risk, pattern was observed for women of parity >/= 2 and preterm birth at 20-23 weeks. Underweight was associated with modest risks for preterm birth at >/= 24 weeks among women in each racial/ethnic group regardless of parity. CONCLUSIONS: The association between women's prepregnancy BMI and risk of spontaneous preterm birth is complex and is influenced by race/ethnicity, gestational age, and parity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genital tract infection accounts for approximately 25-40{\%} of all preterm births. We sought to assess the relationship between preterm birth and selected vaginal bacterial taxa associated with preterm birth either directly or through their association with bacterial vaginosis (BV). STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal fluid for Gram stain was collected between 17 and 22 weeks' gestation as part of a randomized trial of ultrasound-indicated cerclage for preterm birth prevention in women at high risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the Gram stain slides and analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among the 499 participants, Mycoplasma was positively correlated with increased risk of preterm (risk ratio [RR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-2.22) as was Mobiluncus (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.73) and Atopobium (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.1-1.87). However, there were strong interactions between the race/ethnic group and the presence of these and other individual taxa on risk of preterm birth. By contrast, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB)-3 was consistently associated with a reduction in the risk of preterm birth for all racial/ethnic groups (0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.78). CONCLUSION: BV is characterized by a reduction of Lactobacillus, and lactic acid-producing bacteria and the presence of Mobiluncus; we found these factors and the presence of Mycoplasma to be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. By contrast, the presence of a recently identified organism sufficient to cause BV, BVAB3, decreased the risk of preterm birth. These findings give insight into why treating BV has mixed impact on risk of preterm birth.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Policy makers and practitioners need rigorous evaluations of state-based Medicaid enhanced prenatal care programs that provide home visiting to guide improvements and inform future investments. Effects on adverse birth outcomes are of particular interest. OBJECTIVE: To test if participation in the Michigan statewide enhanced prenatal care program, the Maternal Infant Health Program (MIHP), accounting for program timing and dosage, reduced risk for low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth, particularly among black women who are at greater risk for adverse outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Quasi-experimental cohort study. Data, including birth records, Medicaid claims, and monthly program participation, were extracted from the Michigan Department of Community Health warehouse. Participants included all 60 653 pregnant women who had a Medicaid-insured singleton birth between January 1 and December 31, 2010, in Michigan. The MIHP participants were propensity score-matched with nonparticipants based on demographics, previous pregnancies, socioeconomic status, and chronic disease. EXPOSURE: An enhanced prenatal care program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Low birth weight, very low birth weight (VLBW), preterm birth, and very preterm birth. RESULTS: In the propensity score-matched models, black women who enrolled and were screened in the MIHP by the end of the second trimester had lower odds of VLBW (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.97) and very preterm births (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.85) than matched nonparticipants. Black MIHP participants who enrolled and were screened in the program by the second trimester and had at least 3 additional prenatal MIHP contacts had lower odds of LBW (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89), VLBW (0.42; 0.30-0.61), preterm birth (0.71; 0.61-0.83), and very preterm birth (0.41; 0.30-0.57) compared with matched nonparticipants. The MIHP participants of other races and ethnicities who enrolled and were screened in the program by the second trimester and had at least 3 additional prenatal MIHP contacts had lower odds of LBW (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93), VLBW (0.38; 0.22-0.66), preterm birth (0.77; 0.66-0.89), and very preterm birth (0.63; 0.43-0.91) compared with matched nonparticipants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Participation in MIHP reduced the risk for adverse birth outcomes in a diverse, disadvantaged population. The study adds to the evidence base for enhanced prenatal care home visiting programs and informs state and federal investments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between adequacy of prenatal care utilization and risk of fetal and neonatal mortality and adverse outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Linked Birth-Infant Death and Fetal Death data on all deliveries in the United States between 1995 and 2002. Inclusion criteria were singleton births >/=22 weeks of gestation with no known congenital malformation. Inadequate prenatal care was defined according to the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, and its effect on fetal and neonatal death was estimated using unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for maternal age, race, education, and other confounding variables. RESULTS: During our 8-year study period, 32,206,417 births occurred, 28,729,765 (89.2%) of which met inclusion criteria. Inadequate prenatal care utilization occurred in 11.2% of expectant mothers, more commonly among women </=20 years, black non-Hispanic and Hispanic women, and those without high school education. Relative to adequate care, inadequate care was associated with increased risk of prematurity 3.75 (3.73 to 3.77), stillbirth 1.94 (1.89 to 1.99), early neonatal dearth 2.03 (1.97 to 2.09), late neonatal death 1.67 (1.59 to 1.76), and infant death 1.79 (1.76 to 1.82). CONCLUSION: Risk of prematurity, stillbirth, early and late neonatal death, and infant death increased linearly with decreasing care. Given the population effect of this association, public health initiatives should target program expansion to ensure timely and adequate access, particularly for women </=20 years, Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic women, and those without high school education.},

@article{Wilcox2001,
	abstract = {Birthweight is one of the most accessible and most misunderstood variables in epidemiology. A baby's weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree, with developmental problems in childhood and the risk of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal pathway to these health outcomes. Under this assumption of causality, birthweight is used to explain variations in infant mortality and later morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests the link between birthweight and health outcomes may not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume causality are unreliable at best, and biased at worst. The category of 'low birthweight' in particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population (although even this requires special analytical methods). While the ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well grounded, the links between birthweight and a range of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the workings of biological mechanisms with implications for human health.},

Analysis was restricted to 510 288 singleton births from 28 to 42 weeks' gestation with no congenital anomalies. Multivariable linear regression was used to model maternal age and birth order on birthweight, adjusting for infant sex, education, marital status, tobacco use and race. RESULTS: Mean birthweight was lower for non-Hispanic black individuals (NHB, 3166 g) compared with non-Hispanic white individuals (NHW, 3409 g) and Hispanic individuals (3348 g). Controlling for covariates, birthweight increased with maternal age until the early 30s. Race-specific modelling showed that the upper extremes of maternal age had a significant depressive effect on birthweight for NHW and NHB (35+ years, p<0.001), but only age less than 25 years was a significant contributor to lower birthweights for Hispanic individuals, p<0.0001. Among all racial subgroups, birth order had a greater influence on birthweight than maternal age, with the largest incremental increase from first to second births. Among NHB, birth order accounted for a smaller increment in birthweight than for NHW and Hispanic women. CONCLUSION: Birth order exerts a greater influence on birthweight than maternal age, with signficantly different effects across racial subgroups.},

As individuals grow from infancy into old age, they encounter social institutions that may create new exposures to racial bias. Yet, few studies have considered this idea fully. We suggest a framework that shows how racism and health inequities may be viewed from a life course perspective. It applies the ideas of age-patterned exposures, sensitive periods, linked lives, latency period, stress proliferation, historic period, and cohorts. It suggests an overarching idea that racism can structure one's time in asset-building contexts (e.g., education) or disadvantaged contexts (e.g., prison). This variation in time and exposure can contribute to racial inequities in life expectancy and other health outcomes across the life course and over generations.},

@article{Howard2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Black/white disparities in stroke incidence are well documented, but few studies have assessed the contributions to the disparity. Here we assess the contribution of "traditional" risk factors. METHODS: A total of 25 714 black and white men and women, aged>/=45 years and stroke-free at baseline, were followed for an average of 4.4 years to detect stroke. Mediation analysis using proportional hazards analysis assessed the contribution of traditional risk factors to racial disparities. RESULTS: At age 45 years, incident stroke risk was 2.90 (95% CI: 1.72-4.89) times more likely in blacks than in whites and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.34-2.07) times at age 65 years. Adjustment for risk factors attenuated these excesses by 40% and 45%, respectively, resulting in relative risks of 2.14 (95% CI: 1.25-3.67) and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08-1.71). Approximately one half of this mediation is attributable to systolic blood pressure. Further adjustment for socioeconomic factors resulted in total mediation of 47% and 53% to relative risks of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.16-3.47) and 1.30 (1.03-1.65), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Between ages 45 to 65 years, approximately half of the racial disparity in stroke risk is attributable to traditional risk factors (primarily systolic blood pressure) and socioeconomic factors, suggesting a critical need to understand the disparity in the development of these traditional risk factors. Because half of the excess stroke risk in blacks is not attributable to traditional risk factors and socioeconomic factors, differential impact of risk factors, residual confounding, or nontraditional risk factors may also play a role.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to measure overall disparities in pregnancy outcome, incorporating data from the many race and ethnic groups that compose the US population, to improve understanding of how disparities may have changed over time. METHODS: We used Birth Cohort Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files from US Vital Statistics from 1989-1990 and 2005-2006 to examine multigroup indices of racial and ethnic disparities in the overall infant mortality rate (IMR), preterm birth rate, and gestational age-specific IMRs. We calculated selected absolute and relative multigroup disparity metrics weighting subgroups equally and by population size. RESULTS: Overall IMR decreased on the absolute scale, but increased on the population-weighted relative scale. Disparities in the preterm birth rate decreased on both the absolute and relative scales, and across equally weighted and population-weighted indices. Disparities in preterm IMR increased on both the absolute and relative scales. CONCLUSIONS: Infant mortality is a common bellwether of general and maternal and child health. Despite significant decreases in disparities in the preterm birth rate, relative disparities in overall and preterm IMRs increased significantly over the past 20 years.},

The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) investigators found that the rate of suboptimal control of vascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles were significantly greater in African Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW).(2) Moreover, regarding high blood pressure (BP), a triple threat has been described: blacks are not only more likely to have high BP, they are less likely, once diagnosed, to have their high BP controlled, and this suboptimal control has been shown to confer a stroke risk that is 3 times higher among blacks compared to whites for every 10-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (SBP).(3.)},

	abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which LBW is most frequent. For example, in 1991, US infants born to smokers had higher risks of both LBW and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among LBW infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate = 0.79). There are competing theories regarding this so-called "paradox." One is that maternal smoking is beneficial for LBW infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneficial effect of smoking, an inverse association due to stratification on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, LBW infants born to smokers may have a lower risk of mortality than other LBW infants whose LBW is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects). Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality. An appropriate justification for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.},

These 4 components, respectively, correspond to the portion of the effect that is due to neither mediation nor interaction, to just interaction (but not mediation), to both mediation and interaction, and to just mediation (but not interaction). This 4-way decomposition unites methods that attribute effects to interactions and methods that assess mediation. Certain combinations of these 4 components correspond to measures for mediation, whereas other combinations correspond to measures of interaction previously proposed in the literature. Prior decompositions in the literature are in essence special cases of this 4-way decomposition. The 4-way decomposition can be carried out using standard statistical models, and software is provided to estimate each of the 4 components. The 4-way decomposition provides maximum insight into how much of an effect is mediated, how much is due to interaction, how much is due to both mediation and interaction together, and how much is due to neither.},

	abstract = {High body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) is associated with increased asthma risk, but uncertainty persists about the role of physical activity. We estimated the independent and joint associations of hypothetical interventions on BMI and physical activity with the risk of adult-onset asthma in 76,470 asthma-free women from the Nurses' Health Study who were followed between 1988 and 1998. Information about asthma, BMI, physical activity, and other factors was updated every 2 years. We used the parametric g-formula to estimate the 10-year asthma risk in the following 4 scenarios: no intervention, 5% BMI reduction in a 2-year period for those who were overweight or obese, at least 2.5 hours/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and both of the previous 2 interventions. At baseline, women had a mean age of 55 (standard deviation, 7) years and a mean BMI of 25.4 (standard deviation, 4.8). Median time spent in physical activity was 0.7 hours/week. During follow-up, 1,146 women developed asthma. The 10-year asthma risk under no intervention was 1.5%. Compared with no intervention, the population risk ratios were 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 0.99) under the BMI intervention, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.10) under the physical activity intervention, and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.06) under the joint intervention. Interventions on BMI and physical activity may have a modest impact on the risk of adult-onset asthma in this population of US women.},

	abstract = {Statisticians commonly make causal inferences from the results of randomized experiments, but usually question causal inferences from observational studies on the grounds that untestable assumptions are required. This paper explains the basis for this situation and examines, within quite a general framework, various assumptions that appear in the literature. It is demonstrated how the role of each assumption is intimately related to the sort of causal inference being considered. Contrary to general belief, it is shown that neither `no confounding' nor `randomization' are sufficient assumptions for testing the fundamental causal hypothesis of `no causation'. They become sufficient, however, if supplemented by a `modelling' assumption for how unobserved covariates affect potential responses. Without supplementary assumptions, no confounding and randomization allow testing of weaker but more important hypotheses, such as `no mean effect'. This follows from the sufficiency of an assumption of `ignorable treatment assignment' for testing the hypothesis of `no distribution effect'. It is argued that these ideas will have some operational relevance if we can quantify our beliefs about how closely assumptions hold. To illustrate, a novel form of sensitivity analysis is contrasted with an analysis presented by Rosenbaum and Rubin.},

First articulated in a 1960 U.S. epidemiology textbook, the 'web' remains a widely accepted but poorly elaborated model, reflecting in part the contemporary stress on epidemiologic methods over epidemiologic theories of disease causation. This essay discusses the origins, features, and problems of the 'web,' including its hidden reliance upon the framework of biomedical individualism to guide the choice of factors incorporated in the 'web.' Posing the question of the whereabouts of the putative 'spider,' the author examines several contemporary approaches to epidemiologic theory, including those which stress biological evolution and adaptation and those which emphasize the social production of disease. To better integrate biologic and social understandings of current and changing population patterns of health and disease, the essay proposes an ecosocial framework for developing epidemiologic theory. Features of this alternative approach are discussed, a preliminary image is offered, and debate is encouraged.},

Consider a setting with 2 persons per household in which one of the 2 is vaccinated. Vaccinating the first person may protect the second person by preventing the first from being infected and passing the infection on to the second. Alternatively, vaccinating the first person may protect the second by rendering the infection less contagious even if the first is infected. This latter mechanism is sometimes referred to as an "infectiousness effect" of the vaccine. Crude estimators for the infectiousness effect will be subject to selection bias due to stratification on a postvaccination event, namely the infection status of the first person. We use theory concerning causal inference under interference along with a principal-stratification framework to show that, although the crude estimator is biased, it is, under plausible assumptions, conservative for what one might define as a causal infectiousness effect. This applies to bias from selection due to the persons in the comparison, and also to selection due to pathogen virulence. We illustrate our results with an example from the literature.},

@article{Young2014a,
	abstract = {It is routinely argued that, unlike standard regression-based estimates, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimates of the parameters of a correctly specified Cox marginal structural model (MSM) may remain unbiased in the presence of a time-varying confounder affected by prior treatment. Previously proposed methods for simulating from a known Cox MSM lack knowledge of the law of the observed outcome conditional on the measured past. Although unbiased IPW estimation does not require this knowledge, standard regression-based estimates rely on correct specification of this law. Thus, in typical high-dimensional settings, such simulation methods cannot isolate bias due to complex time-varying confounding as it may be conflated with bias due to misspecification of the outcome regression model. In this paper, we describe an approach to Cox MSM data generation that allows for a comparison of the bias of IPW estimates versus that of standard regression-based estimates in the complete absence of model misspecification. This approach involves simulating data from a standard parametrization of the likelihood and solving for the underlying Cox MSM. We prove that solutions exist and computations are tractable under many data-generating mechanisms. We show analytically and confirm in simulations that, in the absence of model misspecification, the bias of standard regression-based estimates for the parameters of a Cox MSM is indeed a function of the coefficients in observed data models quantifying the presence of a time-varying confounder affected by prior treatment. We discuss limitations of this approach including that implied by the 'g-null paradox'.},

@article{Wilcox2011,
	abstract = {Preterm delivery is a powerful predictor of newborn morbidity and mortality. Such problems are due to not only immaturity but also the pathologic factors (such as infection) that cause early delivery. The understanding of these underlying pathologic factors is incomplete at best. To the extent that unmeasured pathologies triggering preterm delivery also directly harm the fetus, they will confound the association of early delivery with neonatal outcomes. This, in turn, complicates studies of newborn outcomes more generally. When investigators analyze the association of risk factors with neonatal outcomes, adjustment for gestational age as a mediating variable will lead to bias. In the language of directed acyclic graphs, gestational age is a collider. The theoretical basis for colliders has been well described, and gestational age has recently been acknowledged as a possible collider. However, the impact of this problem, as well as its implications for perinatal research, has not been fully appreciated. The authors discuss the evidence for confounding and present simulations to explore how much bias is produced by adjustments for gestational age when estimating direct effects. Under plausible conditions, frank reversal of exposure-outcome associations can occur. When the purpose is causal inference, there are few settings in which adjustment for gestational age can be justified.},

@article{Vanderweele2013d,
	abstract = {Peer influence and social interactions can give rise to spillover effects in which the exposure of one individual may affect outcomes of other individuals. Even if the intervention under study occurs at the group or cluster level as in group-randomized trials, spillover effects can occur when the mediator of interest is measured at a lower level than the treatment. Evaluators who choose groups rather than individuals as experimental units in a randomized trial often anticipate that the desirable changes in targeted social behaviors will be reinforced through interference among individuals in a group exposed to the same treatment. In an empirical evaluation of the effect of a school-wide intervention on reducing individual students' depressive symptoms, schools in matched pairs were randomly assigned to the 4Rs intervention or the control condition. Class quality was hypothesized as an important mediator assessed at the classroom level. We reason that the quality of one classroom may affect outcomes of children in another classroom because children interact not simply with their classmates but also with those from other classes in the hallways or on the playground. In investigating the role of class quality as a mediator, failure to account for such spillover effects of one classroom on the outcomes of children in other classrooms can potentially result in bias and problems with interpretation. Using a counterfactual conceptualization of direct, indirect and spillover effects, we provide a framework that can accommodate issues of mediation and spillover effects in group randomized trials. We show that the total effect can be decomposed into a natural direct effect, a within-classroom mediated effect and a spillover mediated effect. We give identification conditions for each of the causal effects of interest and provide results on the consequences of ignoring "interference" or "spillover effects" when they are in fact present. Our modeling approach disentangles these effects. The analysis examines whether the 4Rs intervention has an effect on children's depressive symptoms through changing the quality of other classes as well as through changing the quality of a child's own class.},

@article{Chang2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Every year, 1.1 million babies die from prematurity, and many survivors are disabled. Worldwide, 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks' gestation), with two decades of increasing rates in almost all countries with reliable data. The understanding of drivers and potential benefit of preventive interventions for preterm births is poor. We examined trends and estimate the potential reduction in preterm births for countries with very high human development index (VHHDI) if present evidence-based interventions were widely implemented. This analysis is to inform a rate reduction target for Born Too Soon. METHODS: Countries were assessed for inclusion based on availability and quality of preterm prevalence data (2000-10), and trend analyses with projections undertaken. We analysed drivers of rate increases in the USA, 1989-2004. For 39 countries with VHHDI with more than 10,000 births, we did country-by-country analyses based on target population, incremental coverage increase, and intervention efficacy. We estimated cost savings on the basis of reported costs for preterm care in the USA adjusted using World Bank purchasing power parity. FINDINGS: From 2010, even if all countries with VHHDI achieved annual preterm birth rate reductions of the best performers for 1990-2010 (Estonia and Croatia), 2000-10 (Sweden and Netherlands), or 2005-10 (Lithuania, Estonia), rates would experience a relative reduction of less than 5% by 2015 on average across the 39 countries. Our analysis of preterm birth rise 1989-2004 in USA suggests half the change is unexplained, but important drivers include non-medically indicated labour induction and caesarean delivery and assisted reproductive technologies. For all 39 countries with VHHDI, five interventions modelling at high coverage predicted a 5% relative reduction of preterm birth rate from 9.59% to 9.07% of livebirths: smoking cessation (0.01 rate reduction), decreasing multiple embryo transfers during assisted reproductive technologies (0.06), cervical cerclage (0.15), progesterone supplementation (0.01), and reduction of non-medically indicated labour induction or caesarean delivery (0.29). These findings translate to roughly 58,000 preterm births averted and total annual economic cost savings of about US$3 billion. INTERPRETATION: We recommend a conservative target of a relative reduction in preterm birth rates of 5% by 2015. Our findings highlight the urgent need for research into underlying mechanisms of preterm births, and development of innovative interventions. Furthermore, the highest preterm birth rates occur in low-income settings where the causes of prematurity might differ and have simpler solutions such as birth spacing and treatment of infections in pregnancy than in high-income countries. Urgent focus on these settings is also crucial to reduce preterm births worldwide.

Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the direct effect is not identified when unmeasured variables affect the intermediate and outcome variables. Therefore, bounds on direct effects have been presented via linear programming under two common definitions of direct effects: controlled and natural. Here, we propose bounds on natural direct effects without using linear programming, because such bounds on controlled direct effects have already been proposed. To derive narrow bounds, we introduce two monotonicity assumptions that are weaker than those in previous studies and another monotonicity assumption. Furthermore, we do not assume that an outcome variable is binary, whereas previous studies have made that assumption. An additional advantage of our bounds is that the bounding formulas are extremely simple. The proposed bounds are illustrated using a randomized trial for coronary heart disease.},

To improve the bounds, we further introduce the monotonic assumption about confounders. While previous studies assumed that an outcome is a binary variable, we do not make that assumption.

	abstract = {We apply a linear programming approach which uses the causal risk difference (RD(C)) as the objective function and provides minimum and maximum values that RD(C) can achieve under any set of linear constraints on the potential response type distribution. We consider two scenarios involving binary exposure X, covariate Z and outcome Y. In the first, Z is not affected by X, and is a potential confounder of the causal effect of X on Y. In the second, Z is affected by X and intermediate in the causal pathway between X and Y. For each scenario we consider various linear constraints corresponding to the presence or absence of arcs in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG), monotonicity assumptions, and presence or absence of additive-scale interactions. We also estimate Z-stratum-specific bounds when Z is a potential effect measure modifier and bounds for both controlled and natural direct effects when Z is affected by X. In the absence of any additional constraints deriving from background knowledge, the well-known bounds on RDc are duplicated: -Pr(Y not equalX) </= RD(C) </= Pr(Y=X). These bounds have unit width, but can be narrowed by background knowledge-based assumptions. We provide and compare bounds and bound widths for various combinations of assumptions in the two scenarios and apply these bounds to real data from two studies.},

Such confounders render the direct effect unidentifiable even in cases where the total effect is unconfounded (hence identifiable). Kaufman et al. (2005, Statistics in Medicine 24, 1683-1702) applied a linear programming software to find the minimum and maximum possible values of the ACDE for specific numerical data. In this article, we apply the symbolic Balke-Pearl (1997, Journal of the American Statistical Association 92, 1171-1176) linear programming method to derive closed-form formulas for the upper and lower bounds on the ACDE under various assumptions of monotonicity. These universal bounds enable clinical experimenters to assess the direct effect of treatment from observed data with minimum computational effort, and they further shed light on the sign of the direct effect and the accuracy of the assessments.},

	abstract = {This review addresses the question of whether a short birth interval is associated with adverse nutritional outcomes for the mother or the child. Indices of anthropometric status (maternal weight or body mass index; child growth) and micronutrient status (e.g. iron or vitamin A) were included as outcomes. A computerized search of all relevant papers published since 1966 was completed, and the 'snowball' method was used to identify additional relevant published or unpublished papers. In total, 57 papers were found to contain data regarding the relationship between birth spacing and nutritional outcomes (35 for child nutrition, 11 for maternal anthropometric status, and 11 for maternal anaemia or micronutrient status). Of these, 23 papers were excluded from further consideration because they did not include any multivariate analysis, leaving 34 papers that met the criteria for the review (22 for child nutrition, eight for maternal anthropometric status, and four for maternal anaemia or micronutrient status). The studies on child nutrition outcomes indicate that a longer birth interval is associated with a lower risk of malnutrition in some populations, but not all. In those countries in which the relationship was significant, the reduction in stunting associated with a previous birth interval >or=36 months ranged from approximately 10% to 50%. Some of this reduction may be due to residual confounding, i.e. to factors not included in the analysis (such as breastfeeding and maternal height). The studies on maternal anthropometric outcomes yielded mixed results. Because the nutritional burden on the mother between pregnancies depends on the extent of breastfeeding, the interpregnancy interval is not the best measure of whether the mother has had a chance to recover from the pregnancy, in terms of repleting her nutritional status. Therefore, some studies examined the 'recuperative interval' (duration of the non-pregnant, non-lactating interval) instead. Taken as a whole, the studies do not provide clear evidence of a link between interpregnancy or recuperative interval and maternal anthropometric status. This may be due, in part, to changes in the hormonal regulation of nutrient partitioning between the mother and the fetus when a mother is malnourished. Only four papers were identified that related to micronutrient status, three of which examined maternal anaemia. One study showed an increased risk for maternal anaemia when the interpregnancy interval was <6 months, but the analysis did not control for iron supplementation during pregnancy. The other two studies did not show a significant association between interpregnancy interval and maternal anaemia. One study of micronutrient status indicated no significant relationship between interpregnancy interval and maternal serum zinc, copper, magnesium, ferritin, folate or thyroid-stimulating hormone. Important methodological limitations were apparent in most of the studies. Thus, further research with more comprehensive control of potentially confounding variables is needed.},

The recurrence rate varies as a function of the antecedent for preterm birth: spontaneous versus indicated. Spontaneous preterm birth is the result of either preterm labor with intact membranes or preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes. This article reviews the body of literature describing the risk of recurrence of spontaneous and indicated preterm birth. Also discussed are the factors which modify the risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth (a short sonographic cervical length and a positive cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin test). Patients with a history of an indicated preterm birth are at risk not only for recurrence of this subtype, but also for spontaneous preterm birth. Individuals of black origin have a higher rate of recurrent preterm birth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies suggest that folic acid intake influences the occurrence of low birthweight and preterm delivery. Since 1998, there has been compulsory fortification of flour and other grains with folic acid in the U.S. The objective of this study was to investigate the frequencies of low birthweight and preterm delivery after mandatory folic acid fortification among approximately six million California births. METHODS: The authors investigated prevalences of low birthweight and preterm delivery before and after compulsory fortification among 5,916,630 singleton California live births that occurred from January 1990 through December 2000. RESULTS: The unadjusted prevalences of very low birthweight, low birthweight, and preterm delivery did not substantially vary across birth years. That is, substantial decreased prevalences during the fortification period relative to the period preceding it were not observed. However, analyses that simultaneously adjusted for maternal age, parity, race/ethnicity, education, year of birth, and fortification period revealed the following relative risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI): RR = 0.91, CI 0.88, 0.94 for very low birthweight, RR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.93, 0.96 for low birthweight, and RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.94, 0.97 for preterm delivery. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate small reductions in prevalences of these outcomes associated with the timing of fortification of the U.S. food supply.},

Studied were controls from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study delivered September 1998 to December 2005. Telephone interviews were conducted with 5952 (68% of eligible) mothers. Women were queried about intake of vitamin supplements in the 12 weeks before conception through delivery. A version of the Nurse's Health Study food frequency questionnaire was used to assess food sources. Eight percent of infants ( N = 487) were preterm (<37 weeks). Compared with women who began intake of supplements with folic acid before pregnancy, those who began any time during pregnancy had an ~20% lowered risk of preterm delivery. Lower dietary intakes showed a modest increased risk of preterm delivery: odds ratios were 1.44 (1.01 to 2.04) for lowest quartile intake of folate and 1.27 (0.95 to 1.69) for lowest quartile intake of folic acid compared with the highest. Findings suggest some evidence that folates influenced risks; however, an interpretation of results was also consistent with no association between intake of folates and preterm delivery.},

@article{Dietrich2005,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since January 1998, the Federal Drug Administration has required folic acid fortification of all enriched cereal-grain products in the U.S. This program intended to increase folic acid intake among women of childbearing age in order to decrease their risk of pregnancies affected by neural tube defects. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in serum and erythrocyte folate status of the adult U.S. population following folic acid fortification of enriched cereal-grain products and to explore accompanying changes in food sources and dietary total folate intake. METHODS: We compared data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES): NHANES III, conducted during 1988 to 1994, reflecting the time prior to folate fortification, and NHANES 1999-2000, reflecting the time period after fortification. RESULTS: Mandatory folic acid fortification led to significant increases in both serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations in all sex and age groups. In the overall study population the mean serum folate concentration increased more than two-fold (136%), from 11.4 nmol/L to 26.9 nmol/L, and the mean erythrocyte folate concentration increased by 57 percent, from 375 nmol/L to 590 nmol/L. Less than 10% of women of childbearing age reached the recommended erythrocyte folate concentration of greater than 906 nmol/L that has been shown to be associated with a significant reduction in neural tube defect (NTD) risk. After fortification, the category "bread, rolls, and crackers" became the single largest contributor of total folate to the American diet, contributing 15.6% of total intake, surpassing vegetables, which were the number one folate food source prior to fortification. Dietary intake of total folate increased significantly in almost all sex and age groups, except in females over 60 years of age. The mean dietary total folate intake of the study population increased by 76 microg/d (28%), from 275 microg/d to 351 microg/d. CONCLUSIONS: The fortification of enriched cereal-grain products with folic acid led to a significant improvement of blood folate status of the overall adult, non-supplement using, US population. However, women of childbearing age may take folic acid supplements to reach erythrocyte folate levels that have been associated with decreased risk of NTDs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folic acid is known to prevent neural-tube defects (NTDs) but the size of the effect for a given dose is unclear. We aimed to quantify such an effect. METHODS: We used published data from 13 studies of folic acid supplementation on serum folate concentrations and results from a large cohort study of the risk of NTDs according to serum folate, to measure the preventive effect of specified increases in intake of folic acid. FINDINGS: Serum folate concentrations increase by 0.94 ng/mL (95% CI 0.77-1.10) for every 0.1 mg/day increase in folic acid intake in women aged 20-35 years, and about double that in people aged 40-65. Every doubling of serum folate concentration roughly halves the risk of an NTD. These two effects can be combined to predict the reduction in risk according to intake of extra folic acid and background serum folate concentration. Such results predict that the preventive effect is greater in women with low serum folate than in those with higher concentrations. The results have also been used to predict direct observations from large randomised trials and the effect of food fortification. From a typical western background serum folate of 5 ng/mL, about 0.2 mg/day (the US level of folic acid fortification) would be expected to reduce NTDs by about 20%; a similar effect can be expected from the current British recommendation (0.24 mg/day). An increase of 0.4 mg/day would reduce risk by about 36%, of 1 mg/day by 57%, and taking a 5-mg tablet daily would reduce risk by about 85%. INTERPRETATION: Folic acid fortification levels should be increased. Additionally women planning a pregnancy should take 5 mg folic acid tablets daily, instead of the 0.4 mg dose presently recommended.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low plasma folate concentrations in pregnancy are associated with preterm birth. Here we show an association between preconceptional folate supplementation and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a cohort of 34,480 low-risk singleton pregnancies enrolled in a study of aneuploidy risk, preconceptional folate supplementation was prospectively recorded in the first trimester of pregnancy. Duration of pregnancy was estimated based on first trimester ultrasound examination. Natural length of pregnancy was defined as gestational age at delivery in pregnancies with no medical or obstetrical complications that may have constituted an indication for delivery. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as duration of pregnancy between 20 and 37 wk without those complications. The association between preconceptional folate supplementation and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth was evaluated using survival analysis. Comparing to no supplementation, preconceptional folate supplementation for 1 y or longer was associated with a 70% decrease in the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery between 20 and 28 wk (41 [0.27%] versus 4 [0.04%] spontaneous preterm births, respectively; HR 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.61, p = 0.004) and a 50% decrease in the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery between 28 and 32 wk (58 [0.38%] versus 12 [0.18%] preterm birth, respectively; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.83, p = 0.010). Adjustment for maternal characteristics age, race, body mass index, education, marital status, smoking, parity, and history of prior preterm birth did not have a material effect on the association between folate supplementation for 1 y or longer and spontaneous preterm birth between 20 and 28, and 28 to 32 wk (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.90, p = 0.031 and 0.53, 0.28-0.99, p = 0.046, respectively). Preconceptional folate supplementation was not significantly associated with the risk of spontaneous preterm birth beyond 32 wk. The association between shorter duration (<1 y) of preconceptional folate supplementation and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth was not significant after adjustment for maternal characteristics. However, the risk of spontaneous preterm birth decreased with the duration of preconceptional folate supplementation (test for trend of survivor functions, p = 0.01) and was the lowest in women who used folate supplementation for 1 y or longer. There was also no significant association with other complications of pregnancy studied after adjustment for maternal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Preconceptional folate supplementation is associated with a 50%-70% reduction in the incidence of early spontaneous preterm birth. The risk of early spontaneous preterm birth is inversely proportional to the duration of preconceptional folate supplementation. Preconceptional folate supplementation was specifically related to early spontaneous preterm birth and not associated with other complications of pregnancy.},

@article{Bodnar2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor maternal folate status has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of how individual folate species relate to preterm birth. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the association between maternal folate status as measured by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MeTHF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5FoTHF), and folic acid concentrations, which are the 3 primary folate species in serum, and the risk of preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). DESIGN: A cohort of 313 pregnant women who received care at resident antepartum clinics at Magee-Womens Hospital (Pittsburgh, PA) (2003-2007) was enrolled at <16 wk gestation. We analyzed nonfasting blood samples that were drawn from subjects at enrollment for the 3 folate species by using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Serum 5MeTHF and 5FoTHF concentrations comprised 65% and 33% of total folate concentrations, respectively. In confounder-adjusted, multivariable, log-binomial regression models, 1-SD increases in serum total folate and serum 5MeTHF concentrations were associated with significant reductions in the risk of sPTB (P < 0.05). There was a significant interaction between serum 5MeTHF and 5FoTHF concentrations and risk of preterm birth (P = 0.01). When serum 5MeTHF concentrations were low, there was a positive linear relation between 5FoTHF and risk of preterm birth. When 5MeTHF concentrations were high, there was a strong negative relation between 5FoTHF and preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the relative concentrations of folate species may be more critical than total folate in preventing preterm birth. An improved understanding of folate metabolism during pregnancy may lead to targeted intervention strategies that decrease the rate of preterm birth.},

Those who completed an interview and a food frequency questionnaire, or provided a blood sample for radioassay of serum (n = 2026) and red blood cell (n = 1034) folate were included. Results Mean daily dietary folate intake was 463 μg (SD $\pm$ 248). Intake ≤500 μg was associated with increased preterm delivery (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.4--2.6) controlling for total energy intake. Serum folate levels &lt;16.3 ng/mL and red blood cell folate levels ≤626.6 ng/mL yielded adjusted risk ratios of 1.8 (95% CI 1.3--2.5) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1--2.6), respectively. Patterns were similar for spontaneous and overall preterm birth. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that low folate levels during the second trimester of pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.},

	abstract = {Causal inference is best understood using potential outcomes. This use is particularly important in more complex settings, that is, observational studies or randomized experiments with complications such as non-compliance. The topic of this lecture, the issue of estimating the causal effect of a treatment on a primary outcome that is "censored" by death, is another such complication. For example, suppose that we wish to estimate the effect of a new drug on Quality of Life (QOL) in a randomized experiment, where some of the patients die before the time designated for their QOL to be assessed. Another example with the same structure occurs with the evaluation of an educational program designed to increase final test scores, which are not defined for those who drop out of school before taking the test. A further application is to studies of the effect of job-training programs on wages, where wages are only defined for those who are employed. The analysis of examples like these is greatly clarified using potential outcomes to define causal effects, followed by principal stratification on the intermediated outcomes (e.g., survival).},

The basic insights of the approach are important: pay close attention to modification of treatment effects by variables not observable before treatment decisions are made, and be careful in attributing effects to variables when counterfactuals are ill-defined. These insights have often been taken too far in many areas of application of the approach, including instrumental variables, censoring by death, and surrogate outcomes. A novel finding is that the usual principal stratification estimand in the setting of censoring by death is by itself of little practical value in estimating intervention effects.},

	abstract = {A frequent problem in longitudinal studies is that subjects may miss scheduled visits or be assessed at self-selected points in time. As a result, observed outcome data may be highly unbalanced and the availability of the data may be directly related to the outcome measure and/or some auxiliary factors that are associated with the outcome. If the follow-up visit and outcome processes are correlated, then marginal regression analyses will produce biased estimates. Building on the work of Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao, we propose a class of inverse intensity-of-visit process-weighted estimators in marginal regression models for longitudinal responses that may be observed in continuous time. This allows us to handle arbitrary patterns of missing data as embedded in a subject's visit process. We derive the large sample distribution for our inverse visit-intensity-weighted estimators and investigate their finite sample behaviour by simulation. Our approach is illustrated with a data set from a health services research study in which homeless people with mental illness were randomized to three different treatments and measures of homelessness (as percentage days homeless in the past 3 months) and other auxiliary factors were recorded at follow-up times that are not fixed by design.},

The error terms from the two models are assumed to have a common, but completely arbitrary joint distribution. Using a rank-based estimator for the accelerated failure time model and an artificial censoring device, we construct an asymptotically unbiased estimating function for the linear regression model. The resultant estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A resampling scheme is developed to estimate the limiting covariance matrix.

@article{Seaman2014,
	abstract = {Clustered data are common in medical research. Typically, one is interested in a regression model for the association between an outcome and covariates. Two complications that can arise when analysing clustered data are informative cluster size (ICS) and confounding by cluster (CBC). ICS and CBC mean that the outcome of a member given its covariates is associated with, respectively, the number of members in the cluster and the covariate values of other members in the cluster. Standard generalised linear mixed models for cluster-specific inference and standard generalised estimating equations for population-average inference assume, in general, the absence of ICS and CBC. Modifications of these approaches have been proposed to account for CBC or ICS. This article is a review of these methods. We express their assumptions in a common format, thus providing greater clarity about the assumptions that methods proposed for handling CBC make about ICS and vice versa, and about when different methods can be used in practice. We report relative efficiencies of methods where available, describe how methods are related, identify a previously unreported equivalence between two key methods, and propose some simple additional methods. Unnecessarily using a method that allows for ICS/CBC has an efficiency cost when ICS and CBC are absent. We review tools for identifying ICS/CBC. A strategy for analysis when CBC and ICS are suspected is demonstrated by examining the association between socio-economic deprivation and preterm neonatal death in Scotland. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence in the neonatal literature of statistical approaches accounting for the unique clustering patterns of multiple births and to explore the sensitivity of an actual trial to several analytic approaches to multiples. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of recent perinatal trials assessed the prevalence of studies accounting for clustering of multiples. The Nitric Oxide to Prevent Chronic Lung Disease (NO CLD) trial served as a case study of the sensitivity of the outcome to several statistical strategies. We calculated odds ratios using nonclustered (logistic regression) and clustered (generalized estimating equations, multiple outputation) analyses. RESULTS: In the systematic review, most studies did not describe the random assignment of twins and did not account for clustering. Of those studies that did, exclusion of multiples and generalized estimating equations were the most common strategies. The NO CLD study included 84 infants with a sibling enrolled in the study. Multiples were more likely than singletons to be white and were born to older mothers (P < .01). Analyses that accounted for clustering were statistically significant; analyses assuming independence were not. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical approach to multiples can influence the odds ratio and width of confidence intervals, thereby affecting the interpretation of a study outcome. A minority of perinatal studies address this issue.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to estimate the cumulative risk of perinatal death associated with delivery at each gestational week both at term and post term. STUDY DESIGN: The numbers of antepartum stillbirths, intrapartum stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and surviving neonates delivered at between 37 and 43 weeks' gestation in Scotland, 1985-1996, were obtained from national databases (n = 700,878) after exclusion of multiple pregnancies and deaths caused by congenital abnormality. The numbers of deaths at each gestational week were related to appropriate denominators: antepartum stillbirths were related to ongoing pregnancies, intrapartum stillbirths were related to all births (excluding antepartum stillbirths), and neonatal deaths were related to live births. The cumulative probability of perinatal death associated with delivery at each gestational week was estimated by means of life-table analysis. RESULTS: The gestational week of delivery associated with the lowest cumulative risk of perinatal death was 38 weeks' gestation, whereas the perinatal mortality rate was lowest at 41 weeks' gestation. The risk of death increased more sharply among primigravid women after 38 weeks' gestation because of a greater risk of antepartum stillbirth. The relationships between risk of death and gestational age were similar for the periods 1985-1990 and 1991-1996. CONCLUSION: Delivery at 38 weeks' gestation was associated with the lowest risk of perinatal death.},

@article{Joseph2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although proponents of the fetuses-at-risk approach describe it as a causal model that resolves various conundrums, several areas of semantic and conceptual misapprehension remain. Differences in terminology include use of denominators such as 'ongoing pregnancies' and the need for an ad hoc 'correction factor' in order to calculate gestational age-specific rates. Further, there is conceptual disagreement regarding the proper candidates for neonatal death and related phenomena. Perhaps the most egregious misconception is the belief that rising rates of gestational age-specific perinatal mortality observed under the fetuses-at-risk model automatically imply the need for indiscriminate increases in iatrogenic preterm delivery. DISCUSSION: The term 'fetuses at risk' addresses the plurality of candidates for stillbirth in a multi-fetal pregnancy, while the use of standard terminology such as 'cumulative incidence' and 'incidence density' harmonizes the language of perinatal epidemiology with that used in the general epidemiologic literature. On the conceptual side, it is necessary to integrate clinical insights regarding latent periods into models of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The contention that the fetuses-at-risk approach implies the need for indiscriminate iatrogenic preterm delivery is a non-sequitur (just as rising age-specific cancer death rates do not imply the need for routine chemotherapy and radiation for all middle aged people). Finally, the traditional and fetuses-at-risk models are better viewed in terms of function as prognostic (non-causal) and causal models, respectively. CONCLUSION: A careful examination of terms and concepts helps situate the traditional perinatal and the fetuses-at-risk approaches within the broader context of non-causal and causal models within general epidemiology.},

The rate of unexplained stillbirth (unexplained stillbirths divided by total births) was highest among preterm deliveries, fell to a minimum at 39-40 weeks' gestation, then rose at 41-42 weeks. Rate is generally accepted as measuring risk, but since it is the population of undelivered, not delivered, infants that is at risk of intrauterine death, stillbirth risk would be better measured as the number of impending stillbirths divided by the total number of undelivered fetuses. With this measure the risk of unexplained stillbirth was least in preterm pregnancies, rising fourfold after 39 weeks to a maximum at 41 weeks. At this time, it was also four times higher than at 33 weeks, in contrast to the rate, which was nineteen times lower.},

	abstract = {We consider estimation of the effect of a multiple time point intervention on an outcome of interest, where the intervention nodes are subject to time-dependent confounding by intermediate covariates. In previous work van der Laan (2010) and Stitelman and van der Laan (2011a) developed and implemented a closed form targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) relying on the log-likelihood loss function, and demonstrated important gains relative to inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators and estimating equation based estimators. This TMLE relies on an initial estimator of the entire probability distribution of the longitudinal data structure. To enhance the finite sample performance of the TMLE of the target parameter it is of interest to select the smallest possible relevant part of the data generating distribution, which is estimated and updated by TMLE. Inspired by this goal, we develop a new closed form TMLE of an intervention specific mean outcome based on general longitudinal data structures. The target parameter is represented as an iterative sequence of conditional expectations of the outcome of interest. This collection of conditional means represents the relevant part, which is estimated and updated using the general TMLE algorithm. We also develop this new TMLE for other causal parameters, such as parameters defined by working marginal structural models. The theoretical properties of the TMLE are also practically demonstrated with a small scale simulation study.The proposed TMLE is building upon a previously proposed estimator Bang and Robins (2005) by integrating some of its key and innovative ideas into the TMLE framework.},

Our aim was to compare the usual linear regression adjusted for M to these methods when estimating the controlled direct effect between X and Y in the causal structure and to explore the size of the potential bias. Estimations were computed in several simulated data sets as well as real data. We observed an increased bias of the controlled direct effect estimation using linear regression adjusted for M for larger effects of X on M and larger effects of Z on M. The sequential g-estimator and g-computation gave unbiased estimations with adequate coverage values in every situation studied. With continuous exposure X and mediator M, inverse probability of treatment weighting resulted in some bias and less satisfactory coverage for large effects of X on M and Z on M.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined differences in selected pregnancy-related risk factors, including maternal sociodemographic characteristics, health-related conditions, and periconceptional behavioral factors, among foreign-born versus U.S.-born control mothers across race/ethnic groups. METHODS: We used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the risk factors, for foreign-born Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) mothers, compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. RESULTS: Across all race/ethnic groups, foreign-born mothers were older and had lower odds of obesity compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. With the exception of foreign-born black mothers, foreign-born mothers from other race/ethnic groups had significantly lower odds of binge drinking during the periconceptional period. Compared to U.S.-born, foreign-born Hispanic mothers had twice the odds of gestational diabetes (OR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.36-3.66). Certain health behaviors were less prevalent in foreign-born black mothers (e.g., folic acid use; OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.31-0.96) and foreign-born API mothers (e.g., cigarette smoking; OR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02-0.48). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in pregnancy related risk factors during the periconceptional period and throughout pregnancy were observed between maternal nativity groups and across race/ethnicity. Prevention efforts for both prepregnancy and after conception should be designed and delivered according to maternal nativity for each racial/ethnic group.},

	abstract = {Spina bifida refers to a collection of neural tube defects, including myelomeningocele, meningocele, and myelocele (SB(M) ), as well as lipomyelomeningocele and lipomeningocele (SB(L) ). Maternal race/ethnicity has been associated with an increased risk for spina bifida among offspring. To better understand this relationship, we evaluated different spina bifida subtypes (SB(M) vs. SB(L) ) and sub-phenotypes (anatomic level or presence of additional malformations) by maternal race/ethnicity using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. This study is a large, multisite, population-based study of nonsyndromic birth defects. Prevalence estimates were obtained using data from spina bifida cases (live births, fetal deaths, and elective terminations) and total live births in the study regions. From October 1997 through December 2005, 1,046 infants/fetuses with spina bifida were delivered, yielding a prevalence of 3.06 per 10,000 live births. Differences in the prevalences of SB(M) vs. SB(L) , isolated versus non-isolated SB(M) , and lesion level in isolated SB(M) among case offspring were observed by maternal race/ethnicity. Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White mothers, offspring of Hispanic mothers had higher prevalences of each subtype and most sub-phenotypes, while offspring of NH Black mothers generally had lower prevalences. Furthermore, differences in race/ethnicity among those with isolated SB(M) were more pronounced by sex. For instance, among male offspring, the prevalence of isolated SB(M) was significantly higher for those with Hispanic mothers compared to NH White mothers [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.95]. These findings provide evidence that certain spina bifida subtypes and sub-phenotypes may be etiologically distinct.},

@article{vanderLaan2014,
	abstract = {In order to obtain concrete results, we focus on estimation of the treatment specific mean, controlling for all measured baseline covariates, based on observing independent and identically distributed copies of a random variable consisting of baseline covariates, a subsequently assigned binary treatment, and a final outcome. The statistical model only assumes possible restrictions on the conditional distribution of treatment, given the covariates, the so-called propensity score. Estimators of the treatment specific mean involve estimation of the propensity score and/or estimation of the conditional mean of the outcome, given the treatment and covariates. In order to make these estimators asymptotically unbiased at any data distribution in the statistical model, it is essential to use data-adaptive estimators of these nuisance parameters such as ensemble learning, and specifically super-learning. Because such estimators involve optimal trade-off of bias and variance w.r.t. the infinite dimensional nuisance parameter itself, they result in a sub-optimal bias/variance trade-off for the resulting real-valued estimator of the estimand. We demonstrate that additional targeting of the estimators of these nuisance parameters guarantees that this bias for the estimand is second order and thereby allows us to prove theorems that establish asymptotic linearity of the estimator of the treatment specific mean under regularity conditions. These insights result in novel targeted minimum loss-based estimators (TMLEs) that use ensemble learning with additional targeted bias reduction to construct estimators of the nuisance parameters. In particular, we construct collaborative TMLEs (C-TMLEs) with known influence curve allowing for statistical inference, even though these C-TMLEs involve variable selection for the propensity score based on a criterion that measures how effective the resulting fit of the propensity score is in removing bias for the estimand. As a particular special case, we also demonstrate the required targeting of the propensity score for the inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator using super-learning to fit the propensity score.},

@article{vandenBerg2012,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic status (SES) is adversely associated with perinatal outcomes. This association is likely to be mediated by tobacco exposure. However, previous studies were limited to single perinatal outcomes and devoted no attention to environmental tobacco exposure. Therefore, this study aimed firstly to explain the role of maternal smoking in the association between maternal education and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA), and secondly to explain whether environmental tobacco smoke mediates these associations further. STUDY DESIGN: This study was nested in a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) study. Analyses were done in a sample of 3821 pregnant women of Dutch origin, using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Least educated women, who were more often smoking and exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, had a significantly higher risk of PTB (OR 1.95 [95% CI: 1.19-3.20]), LBW (OR 2.41 [95% CI: 1.36-4.27]) and SGA (OR 1.90 [95% CI 1.32-2.74]) than highly educated women. The mediating effect of smoking in the least educated women was 43% for PTB, 55% for LBW and 66% for SGA. Environmental tobacco smoke did not explain these associations further. After adjustment for maternal smoking, the association between lower maternal education and pregnancy outcomes was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking explains to a considerable extent the association between lower maternal education and adverse perinatal outcomes. Therefore, tobacco-interventions in lower educated women should be primarily focussed on maternal smoking to reduce PTB, LBW, and SGA. Additional attention to environmental tobacco exposure does not seem to reduce educational inequalities in perinatal outcomes.},

@article{Ko2014,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The infant mortality rate is a sensitive and commonly used indicator of the socio-economic status of a population. Generally, studies investigating the relationship between infant mortality and socio-economic status have focused on full-term infants in Western populations. This study examined the effects of education level and employment status on full-term and preterm infant mortality in Korea. Data were collected from the National Birth Registration Database and merged with data from the National Death Certification Database. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: In total, 1,316,184 singleton births registered in Korea's National Birth Registration Database between January 2004 and December 2006 were included in the study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Paternal and maternal education levels were inversely related to infant mortality in preterm and full-term infants following multivariate adjusted logistic models. Parental employment status was not associated with infant mortality in full-term infants, but was associated with infant mortality in preterm infants, after adjusting for place of birth, gender, marital status, paternal age, maternal age and parity. CONCLUSIONS: Low paternal and maternal education levels were found to be associated with infant mortality in both full-term and preterm infants. Low parental employment status was found to be associated with infant mortality in preterm infants but not in full-term infants. In order to reduce inequalities in infant mortality, public health interventions should focus on providing equal access to education.},

	abstract = {Paediatricians need to be aware of the broad implications that sufficient maternal folic acid intake has on the wellbeing of the embryo and fetus. There is now strong evidence that adequate periconceptional maternal folic acid supplementation during critical periods of organ formation is associated with reduction in both the occurrence and recurrence of neural tube defects, congenital heart defects (particularly conotruncal heart defects), obstructive urinary tract anomalies, limb deficiencies, orofacial clefts and congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Inadequate maternal folic acid intake is associated with preterm deliveries, intra-uterine growth retardation, placental abruption and infarction, while maternal folic acid supplementation is associated with a reduction in preterm deliveries and intra-uterine growth retardation. Recently adequate folic acid intake in adults has been associated with a reduction in adult cardiovascular disease and some cancers. A common mutation in the 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene has been identified which produces a thermolabile variant of 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase with reduced enzyme activity. The common mutation is a risk factor both for neural tube defects and adult cardiovascular diseases. Folic acid acts to increase the activity of the variant methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase thereby reducing plasma homocysteine levels. However the polymorphism does not explain all of the protective effects of folic acid. CONCLUSION: Primary prevention of birth defects by adequate periconceptional folic acid supplementation is a major public health opportunity and has wide implications in reducing both mortality and morbidity due to birth defects and several adult diseases. It follows that there would also be a curbing of health care costs related to those disorders.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To investigate how congenital malformations (CM) are associated with preterm (PT) births. METHODS: A population cohort study analyzed data from the New York State Congenital Malformations Registry to look at live births from the Lower Hudson Valley Region from 2000-2003. ICD9 codes identified all cases and types of CM in addition to cases with multiple malformations. Subjects were categorized into one of three gestational age (GA) groups. Only cases with a known GA at birth were included. Poisson regression analysis established a risk ratio for children born with a CM of being born preterm. RESULTS: The PT birth rate was 11.2% and the CM rate 3%. Children with a CM were more likely to be born PT (RR: 2.20; CI: 2.01-2.40), moderately preterm (RR: 1.95; CI: 1.76-2.15), and very preterm (RR: 3.45; CI: 2.95-4.04) than term. This relationship was maintained for most organ systems and malformation types evaluated when checked individually. Being born with more than one CM increased the likelihood of being born PT (OR: 1.72; CI: 1.37-2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital malformations in children have a significant impact upon the likelihood of being born PT, and contribute significantly to the degree of prematurity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A few studies have investigated the association between male caffeine consumption in adult life and semen quality with conflicting results, but so far no studies have explored the effect of prenatal coffee exposure. We studied the association between prenatal coffee and current caffeine exposure and semen quality and levels of reproductive hormones. METHODS: From a Danish pregnancy cohort established in 1984-1987, 347 sons out of 5109 were selected for a follow-up study conducted 2005-2006. Semen and blood samples were analyzed for conventional semen characteristics and reproductive hormones and were related to information on maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and present caffeine consumption. Data were available for 343 men. RESULTS: There was a tendency toward decreasing crude median semen volume (P = 0.06) and adjusted mean testosterone (P = 0.06) and inhibin B (P = 0.09) concentrations with increasing maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy. Sons of mothers drinking 4-7 cups/day had lower testosterone levels than sons of mothers drinking 0-3 cups/day (P = 0.04). Current male caffeine intake was associated with increasing testosterone levels (P = 0.007). Men with a high caffeine intake had approximately 14% higher concentration of testosterone than those with a low caffeine intake (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The results observed in this study are only tentative, but they do not exclude a small to moderate effect of prenatal coffee exposure on semen volume and levels of reproductive hormones. Present adult caffeine intake did not show any clear associations with semen quality, but high caffeine intake was associated with a higher testosterone concentration.},

@article{Zhang2010,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Customisation of birthweight-for-gestational-age standards for maternal characteristics assumes that variation in birth weight as a result of those characteristics is physiological, rather than pathological. Maternal height and parity are among the characteristics widely assumed to be physiological. Our objective was to test that assumption by using an association with perinatal mortality as evidence of a pathological effect. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Sweden. POPULATION: A total of 952 630 singletons born at > or =28 weeks of gestation in the period 1992-2001. METHODS: We compared perinatal mortality among mothers of short stature (<160 cm) versus those of normal height (> or =160 cm), and primiparous versus multiparous mothers, using an internal reference of estimated fetal weight for gestational age. The total effects of maternal height and parity were estimated, as well as the effects of height and parity independent of birthweight (controlled direct effects). All analyses were based on fetuses at risk, using marginal structural Cox models for the estimation of total and controlled direct effects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and early neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The estimated total effect (HR; 95% CI) of short stature on perinatal death among short mothers was 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) compared with women of normal height; the effect of short stature independent of birthweight (controlled direct effect) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1.0) among small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births, but 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.3) among non-SGA births. Similar results were observed for primiparous mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of maternal short stature or primiparity on perinatal mortality is partly mediated through SGA birth. Thus, birthweight differences resulting from these maternal characteristics appear not only to be physiological, but also to have an important pathological component.},

(Also listed in {$[$}4{$]$} and {$[$}5{$]$}.) In essence, the generalization (1) herein is accomplished by supplying a positive parameter, p, as an exponent in the exponential factor of the gamma distribution. The moment generating function is shown, and cumulative probabilities are related directly to the incomplete gamma function (tabulated in {$[$}6{$]$}). Distributions are given for various functions of independent "generalized gamma variates" thus defined, special attention being given to the sum of such variates. Convolution results occur in alternating series form, with coefficients whose evaluation may be tedious and lengthy. An upper bound is provided for the modulus of each term, and simplified computation methods are developed for some special cases. A corollary is derived showing that the researches of Robbins in {$[$}7{$]$} apply to a larger class of problems than was treated in {$[$}7{$]$}. Extensions of his methods lead to iterative formulae for the coefficients in series obtained for an even larger class of problems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Fetuses-at-risk denominators are commonly used in research on preterm stillbirth, but applications to postnatal outcomes such as preterm infant mortality are controversial. We evaluated whether biased associations between maternal risk factors and preterm infant mortality caused by stratification by preterm birth could be avoided using fetuses-at-risk risk ratios. METHODS:: Data included 3 277 570 births drawn from the linked live birth-death file for Canada from 1990 through 2005. We used maternal age as the risk factor, and estimated the association with stillbirth, early neonatal, late neonatal and postneonatal mortality by gestational interval (22-24, 25-27, 28-31, 32-36, >/=37 weeks). Models were run using (i) log-binomial regression stratified by preterm gestational age, and (ii) unstratified log-binomial regression using fetuses-at-risk denominators. RESULTS:: Extremes of maternal age were associated with higher mortality among term births. Among preterm births, the stratified model suggested a protective, null or attenuated association of extremes of maternal age with stillbirth, early, late and post neonatal mortality. The unstratified fetuses-at-risk model, however, resulted in the expected higher risk of mortality at extremes of maternal age for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:: Fetuses-at-risk regression can avoid paradoxical associations between maternal exposures and mortality of infants born early in gestation, caused by preterm birth stratification bias. The fetuses-at-risk approach can be extended through the first year of life, or potentially beyond, depending on the outcome and presence of unmeasured confounders associated with preterm birth.},

@article{Paul2008,
	abstract = {Racial disparity in preterm birth is one of the most salient, yet least well-understood health disparities in the United States. The preterm birth disparity may be due to differences in how women experience their racial identity in light of neighborhood factors, psychosocial stress, or the prevalence of or response to genital tract infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). The latest research emphasizes a need to explore all these factors simultaneously. This cross-sectional study of parous women in King County, Washington, USA investigated the effects of household income, psychosocial stress, and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics on risk of BV after accounting for known individual-level risk factors. Relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and medical data were linked to U.S. census socioeconomic data by geocoding subjects' residential addresses. It was found that having a low income was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of BV among African American but not White American women. A higher number of stressful life events was significantly associated with higher BV prevalence among both African American and White American women. However, perceived stress was not related to BV risk among either group of women. Among White American women, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) was univariately associated with increased BV prevalence by principal components analysis, but was no longer significant after adjusting for individual-level risk factors. No neighborhood SES effects were observed for African American women. These results suggest that both the effects of individual- and neighborhood-level risk factors for BV may differ importantly by racial group, and stressful life events may have physiological effects independent of perceived stress.},

This report describes how the sample was designed, shows response rates for various subgroups of men and women, describes how the sample weights were computed to make national estimates possible, shows how missing data were imputed for a limited set of key variables, and describes the proper ways to estimate sampling errors from the NSFG. The report includes both nontechnical summaries for readers who need only general information and more technical detail for readers who need an in-depth understanding of these topics. METHODS: The NSFG Cycle 6 was based on an independent, national probability sample of men and women 15-44 years of age. It was the first NSFG ever to include a national sample of men 15-44 as well as a sample of women. Fieldwork was carried out by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research (ISR) under a contract with NCHS. In-person, face-to-face interviews were conducted by professional female interviewers using laptop computers. In all, 12,571 women and men-7,643 females and 4,928 males-were interviewed, the largest NSFG ever done. RESULTS: Analysis of NSFG Cycle 6 data requires the use of sampling weights and estimation of sampling errors that accounts for the complex sample design and estimation features of the survey. Examples of how to use several available software packages that incorporate complex design features in estimation, such as SAS, SUDAAN, and STATA, are presented.},

The NSFG is a continuous national survey of men and women 15-44 years of age designed to provide national estimates of factors affecting pregnancy and birth rates; men's and women's health; and parenting. METHODS: The survey used in-person, face-to-face interviews conducted by trained female interviewers. One person per household was interviewed from a national area probability sample. The data collection used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). Separate questionnaires were used for male and female respondents. The last section of the questionnaires used a self-administered technique called audio computer-assisted self-interviewing or ACASI. Each data collection period lasted 12 weeks-10 weeks for "Phase 1," the main data collection protocol, and 2 weeks for "Phase 2," an intensive attempt to locate and interview nonrespondents. RESULTS: Each year, about 5,000 persons were interviewed in about 33 areas, called primary sampling units (PSUs). Over a 4-year period, 110 PSUs will be used. This report gives an overview of the procedures used in the conduct of the continuous NSFG. A later report will describe response rates and other results of the data collection, but the early fieldwork has gone well.},

We propose a 12-point plan to reduce Black-White disparities in birth outcomes using a life-course approach. The first four points (increase access to interconception care, preconception care, quality prenatal care, and healthcare throughout the life course) address the needs of African American women for quality healthcare across the lifespan. The next four points (strengthen father involvement, systems integration, reproductive social capital, and community building) go beyond individual-level interventions to address enhancing family and community systems that may influence the health of pregnant women, families, and communities. The last four points (close the education gap, reduce poverty, support working mothers, and undo racism) move beyond the biomedical model to address the social and economic inequities that underlie much of health disparities. Closing the Black-White gap in birth outcomes requires a life course approach which addresses both early life disadvantages and cumulative allostatic load over the life course.},

	abstract = {To examine the association between interpregnancy interval and low birthweight (< 2500 g), preterm delivery (< 37 weeks' gestation), and inadequate fetal growth, we studied a population-based sample of 23,388 white and 4885 black women at low risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes who delivered their first and second infants in Georgia from 1980 to 1992. We used fetal death and livebirth certificates. The interpregnancy interval was the time from delivery to the woman's next conception. For each pregnancy outcome, we stratified by race and used logistic regression to assess the association between interpregnancy interval and outcome, while controlling for confounders. Intervals < 6 months were observed for 3.7% of white women and 7.0% of black women and intervals > or = 48 months were seen for 16.8% of white women and 24.8% of black women. Results from logistic regression showed that, for both races, interpregnancy interval was associated with low birthweight and preterm delivery. Nearly all of the increased risk occurred in intervals < 6 months or > or = 48 months. The magnitude of the increase in risk associated with these intervals ranged from modest to moderate and was similar for black and white women. Because short interpregnancy intervals are rare and are weak risk factors among low-risk women, efforts to lengthen interpregnancy intervals are unlikely to reduce substantially their rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

	abstract = {We introduce the sinh-arcsinh transformation and hence, by applying it to a generating distribution with no parameters other than location and scale, usually the normal, a new family of sinh-arcsinh distributions. This four-parameter family has symmetric and skewed members and allows for tailweights that are both heavier and lighter than those of the generating distribution. The central place of the normal distribution in this family affords likelihood ratio tests of normality that are superior to the state-of-the-art in normality testing because of the range of alternatives against which they are very powerful. Likelihood ratio tests of symmetry are also available and are very successful. Three-parameter symmetric and asymmetric subfamilies of the full family are also of interest. Heavy-tailed symmetric sinh-arcsinh distributions behave like Johnson SU distributions, while their light-tailed counterparts behave like sinh-normal distributions, the sinh-arcsinh family allowing a seamless transition between the two, via the normal, controlled by a single parameter. The sinh-arcsinh family is very tractable and many properties are explored. Likelihood inference is pursued, including an attractive reparameterization. Illustrative examples are given. A multivariate version is considered. Options and extensions are discussed.},

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the vital statistics data for multiparous white and black women in Michigan who delivered a singleton live birth during the period 1993 through 1998, using stratified and logistic regression techniques. RESULTS: Among women of both races, the risk for delivering low birth weight, premature, and small-for-gestational-age birth was lowest if the interpregnancy interval was 18 to 23 months. In comparison, among white women, the odds ratios for the 3 outcomes were 1.5, 1.3, and 1.3, respectively, if the interval was <6 months, and 1.9, 1.4, and 1.7, respectively, if the interval was > or =120 months, controlling for other factors. Similarly, among black women, the odds ratios were 1.5, 1.2, and 1.3, respectively, if the interval was <6 months, and 1.6, 1.3, and 1.4, respectively, if the interval was > or =120 months. CONCLUSION: An interpregnancy interval of 18 to 23 months is associated with the lowest risk for adverse perinatal outcomes among both white and black women.},

Statistical analyses were done by using the Mantel-Haenszel correlation statistic chi-square test and logistic regression. The proportion of livebirths associated with ≤12-month interpregnancy intervals was the lowest among non-Hispanic whites (18.5%, 95% confidence interval 18.5--18.5) and the highest among Native Americans (29.7%, 95% confidence interval 29.2--30.2). As compared with mothers with >12-month intervals, mothers with <6-month intervals had an approximately 50% to 80% increased risk of very low (<1.5 kg) birth weight delivery and a 30% to 90% increased risk of very preterm (<32 weeks) delivery. Logistic regression analyses showed that the adverse effects of short intervals were reduced by about 10% but remained for the most part significant after controlling for potential confounding by maternal age, education, parity, marital status, prenatal care, smoking, and previous preterm delivery.

	abstract = {Epidemiologic studies often encounter missing covariate values. While simple methods such as stratification on missing-data status, conditional-mean imputation, and complete-subject analysis are commonly employed for handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods can be biased under reasonable circumstances. The authors review these results in the context of logistic regression and present simulation experiments showing the limitations of the methods. The method based on missing-data indicators can exhibit severe bias even when the data are missing completely at random, and regression (conditional-mean) imputation can be inordinately sensitive to model misspecification. Even complete-subject analysis can outperform these methods. More sophisticated methods, such as maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and weighted estimating equations, have been given extensive attention in the statistics literature. While these methods are superior to simple methods, they are not commonly used in epidemiology, no doubt due to their complexity and the lack of packaged software to apply these methods. The authors contrast the results of multiple imputation to simple methods in the analysis of a case-control study of endometrial cancer, and they find a meaningful difference in results for age at menarche. In general, the authors recommend that epidemiologists avoid using the missing-indicator method and use more sophisticated methods whenever a large proportion of data are missing.},

Formal frameworks for causal inference developed over the past decades have the potential to improve the rigor of this process. However, the appropriate role for formal causal thinking in applied epidemiology remains a matter of debate. We argue that a formal causal framework can help in designing a statistical analysis that comes as close as possible to answering the motivating causal question, while making clear what assumptions are required to endow the resulting estimates with a causal interpretation. A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.},

	abstract = {As with other instrumental variable (IV) analyses, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies rest on strong assumptions. These assumptions are not routinely systematically evaluated in MR applications, although such evaluation could add to the credibility of MR analyses. In this article, the authors present several methods that are useful for evaluating the validity of an MR study. They apply these methods to a recent MR study that used fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype as an IV to estimate the effect of obesity on mental disorder. These approaches to evaluating assumptions for valid IV analyses are not fail-safe, in that there are situations where the approaches might either fail to identify a biased IV or inappropriately suggest that a valid IV is biased. Therefore, the authors describe the assumptions upon which the IV assessments rely. The methods they describe are relevant to any IV analysis, regardless of whether it is based on a genetic IV or other possible sources of exogenous variation. Methods that assess the IV assumptions are generally not conclusive, but routinely applying such methods is nonetheless likely to improve the scientific contributions of MR studies.},

	abstract = {Ill-defined causal questions present serious problems for observational studies-problems that are largely unappreciated. This paper extends the usual counterfactual framework to consider causal questions about compound treatments for which there are many possible implementations (for example, "prevention of obesity"). We describe the causal effect of compound treatments and their identifiability conditions, with a special emphasis on the consistency condition. We then discuss the challenges of using the estimated effect of a compound treatment in one study population to inform decisions in the same population and in other populations. These challenges arise because the causal effect of compound treatments depends on the distribution of the versions of treatment in the population. Such causal effects can be unpredictable when the versions of treatment are unknown. We discuss how such issues of "transportability" are related to the consistency condition in causal inference. With more carefully framed questions, the results of epidemiologic studies can be of greater value to decision-makers.},

	abstract = {Many epidemiologic studies identify contrasts between an ``always-exposed'' population and a ``never-exposed'' population. Such ``exposure effects'' are perhaps most valuable in discussing individual lifestyle changes, or in clinical care; they may be less valuable in estimating the potential effects of realistic public health interventions. Various methods, among them population attributable fractions and generalized impact fractions, attempt to obtain more policy-relevant estimates of ``population intervention'' effects, but such methods remain rare in the epidemiologic literature. Here, we describe the use of the parametric g-formula as a tool for the estimation of population intervention effects in longitudinal data. Our discussion is motivated by a previous study of the effect of incident pregnancy on time to virological failure among human immunodeficiency virus-positive women initiating antiretroviral therapy in South Africa between 2004 and 2011. We show that 1) interventional estimates of effect can be estimated in longitudinal data using the parametric g-formula and 2) exposure effects and population interventional effects can have dramatically different interpretations and magnitudes in real-world data. Epidemiologists should consider estimating interventional effects in addition to exposure effects; doing so would allow the results of epidemiologic studies to be more immediately relevant to policy-makers and to implementation science efforts.},

Despite this, it is not uncommon to see the complement of the Kaplan-Meier estimate used in this setting and interpreted as the probability of failure. If one desires an estimate that can be interpreted in this way, however, the cumulative incidence estimate is the appropriate tool to use in such situations. We believe the more commonly seen representations of the Kaplan-Meier estimate and the cumulative incidence estimate do not lend themselves to easy explanation and understanding of this interpretation. We present, therefore, a representation of each estimate in a manner not ordinarily seen, each representation utilizing the concept of censored observations being 'redistributed to the right.' We feel these allow a more intuitive understanding of each estimate and therefore an appreciation of why the Kaplan-Meier method is inappropriate for estimation purposes in the presence of competing risks, while the cumulative incidence estimate is appropriate.},

The worldwide population prevalence is about 1%. Autism affects more male than female individuals, and comorbidity is common (>70% have concurrent conditions). Individuals with autism have atypical cognitive profiles, such as impaired social cognition and social perception, executive dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing. These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at the systems level. Genetics has a key role in the aetiology of autism, in conjunction with developmentally early environmental factors. Large-effect rare mutations and small-effect common variants contribute to risk. Assessment needs to be multidisciplinary and developmental, and early detection is essential for early intervention. Early comprehensive and targeted behavioural interventions can improve social communication and reduce anxiety and aggression. Drugs can reduce comorbid symptoms, but do not directly improve social communication. Creation of a supportive environment that accepts and respects that the individual is different is crucial.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between uterine artery Doppler indices and stillbirth in routinely screened populations. METHODS: Second-trimester uterine artery Doppler indices at 19 to 23 weeks of gestation were obtained from a large cohort of women. Pregnancy losses recorded on a mandatory national register were cross-linked to the Doppler database. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the risk of stillbirth based on the uterine artery Doppler resistance indices. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of uterine artery Doppler indices and other more conventional risk factors on the likelihood of stillbirth. RESULTS: Data were available from 15,835 women with 144 stillbirths (9.1 stillbirths per 1,000 births). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of stillbirth (39.41 per 1000) in women with uterine artery Doppler indices greater than the 90th percentile was sevenfold higher (95% confidence interval 4.81-9.57) than the reference population (5.36 per 1000) with Doppler indices less than or equal to the 90th percentile. The positive predictive and negative predictive values for the 90th percentile uterine artery Doppler cutoff were 3.79% and 99.46%, respectively [corrected] The sensitivities of the 90th, 95, and 99th percentile uterine artery Doppler resistance index cut-offs for the sensitivity of stillbirth were 46.2%, 35.4%, and 15.4%, respectively. Conventional risk factors for term stillbirth such as ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking no longer contributed to stillbirth risk when uterine artery Doppler indices were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Elevated second-trimester Doppler indices, a proxy for impaired placentation, are more strongly associated with stillbirth than conventional risk factors. Risk factors such as ethnicity, maternal age, BMI, and smoking contribute to risk of term stillbirth through uteroplacental dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between infant mortality in a first pregnancy and risk for stillbirth in a second pregnancy. DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Maternally linked cohort data files for the state of Missouri. POPULATION: Women who had two singleton pregnancies in Missouri during the period 1989-2005 (n = 320 350). METHODS: Women whose first pregnancy resulted in infant death were compared with those whose infant from the first pregnancy survived the first year of life. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was employed to compare probabilities for stillbirth in the second pregnancy between both groups of women. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were generated to assess the association between infant mortality in the first pregnancy and stillbirth in the second pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure was defined as infant mortality in the first pregnancy, and the outcome was defined as stillbirth in the second pregnancy. RESULTS: Women with prior infant deaths were about three times as likely to experience stillbirth in their subsequent pregnancy (AHR 2.91; 95% CI 2.02-4.18). White women with a previous infant death were nearly twice as likely to experience a subsequent stillbirth, compared with white women with a surviving infant (AHR 1.96; 95% CI 1.13-3.39). Black women with a previous infant death were more than four times as likely to experience subsequent stillbirth, compared with black women with a surviving infant (AHR 4.28; 95% CI 2.61-6.99). CONCLUSIONS: Previous infant mortality results in an elevated risk for subsequent stillbirth, with the most profound increase observed among black women. Interconception care should consider prior childbearing experiences to avert subsequent fetal loss.},

	abstract = {The probability of a type of failure that is not inevitable, but can be precluded by other events such as death, is given by the cumulative incidence function. In cardiac research articles, it has become known as the actual probability, in contrast to the actuarial methods of estimation, usually implemented by the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate. Unlike cumulative incidence, KM attempts to predict what the latent failure probability would be if death were eliminated. To do this, the KM method assumes that the risk of dying and the risk of failure are independent. But this assumption is not true for many cardiac applications in which the risks of failure and death are negatively correlated (ie, patients with a higher risk of dying have a lower risk of failure, and patients with a lower risk of death have a higher risk of failure, which is a condition called informative censoring). Recent editorials in two cardiac journals have promoted the use of the KM method (actuarial estimate) for competing risk events (specifically for heart valve performance) and criticized the use of the cumulative incidence (actual) estimates. This report has two aims: to explain the difference between these two estimates and to show why the KM is generally not appropriate. In the process we will rely on alternative representations of the KM estimator (using redistribution to the right and inverse probability weighting) to explain the difference between the two estimates and to show how it may be possible to adjust KM to overcome the informative censoring.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of stillbirth in apparently uncomplicated monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies by systematic review and meta-analysis and compare it with that in uncomplicated dichorionic pregnancies. DATA SOURCES: We performed an electronic search (January 1985 to April 2012) of Medline, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Studies detailing gestational-age specific stillbirth rates after 24 weeks of gestation in monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies uncomplicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome, growth restriction, or major anomalies. The rate and risk of stillbirth were calculated in 2-week gestational age blocks and compared in controlled studies with dichorionic pregnancies. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We evaluated 361 studies to include nine informative studies, four after additional data from the investigators. The rate of stillbirth per 1,000 uncomplicated monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies at 32-33, 34-35, and 36-37 weeks of gestation was 5.1, 6.8, and 6.2, respectively. The risk of stillbirth per pregnancy at 32, 34, and 36 weeks of gestation was 1.6%, 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Compared with uncomplicated dichorionic pregnancies, the odds ratio for stillbirth per pregnancy at 32, 34, and 36 weeks of gestation was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-12.6), 3.7 (CI 1.1-12.0), and 8.5 (CI 1.6-44.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: Uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies are at substantial risk of stillbirth throughout the third trimester, which is severalfold higher than in dichorionic twin pregnancies. Given the risk of fetal death to the cotwin, these data should inform decisions around timing of delivery in seemingly normal monochorionic twin pregnancies.},

	abstract = {Most vitamin status parameters change significantly during pregnancy. A number of factors have been associated with this hypovitaminaemia of pregnancy. From our data, it was concluded that the initial value of a vitamin status parameter was by far the main determinant of the changes of vitamin levels during pregnancy: the higher the value, the steeper the decrease. Some hormonal variables were associated with these changes as well. This is highly suggestive of a resetting of vitamin homeostasis in blood, with a retention of vitamins in maternal tissues. The postpartum changes of vitamin levels provide insight into the 'net cost' of vitamins during pregnancy. Most serum blood levels of vitamins normalized shortly after delivery. Serum vitamin B6 levels increased slowly with 25% below the acceptable range at 6 months postpartum. However, the GGOT stimulation ratio, indicative for vitamin B6 cellular content, was completely normal at the time. Serum folacin was the only exception, with 45% serum levels in the marginal or deficient range; 20% of this group had deficient or marginal red cell folacin levels as well. This indicates that the 'net cost' of folacin during pregnancy is considerable, and repletion of folacin stores takes more than 6 months.},

We re-analysed data from a large randomised controlled trial performed between 1966 and 1967 and combined the results with those from trials included in a Cochrane review. A total of 2928 women were randomised: 1977 were allocated to placebo, 466 to folic acid 200 microg/day and 485 to folic acid 5 mg/day. Folic acid supplementation was not associated with any difference in mean birthweight, placental weight or gestational age. When combined with trials in the Cochrane review folic acid at high doses was associated with reduced risk of low birthweight (pooled relative risk 0.73 [95% CI 0.53, 0.99]). We found no conclusive evidence of benefit for folic acid supplementation in pregnant women given from time of booking onwards.},

	abstract = {Whether or not folic acid supplementation promotes the progression of colorectal preneoplastic lesions to cancer is an important public health issue, given mandatory fortification and widespread supplemental use of folic acid in North America. We investigated the effect of folic acid supplementation on the progression of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), the earliest precursor of colorectal cancer. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 152) were placed on a control diet (2 mg folic acid/kg diet) at weaning and ACF were induced by azoxymethane. Six weeks post-ACF induction, rats were randomized to receive 0, 2, 5 or 8 mg folic acid/kg diet. At 34 weeks of age, rats were killed, and colorectal tumor parameters, plasma folate and homocysteine (a sensitive inverse indicator of tissue folate status) concentrations and rectal epithelial proliferation were determined. Although the number of ACF increased as dietary folic acid levels increased (P = 0.015), the incidence of colorectal tumors did not differ significantly among the four dietary groups. However, tumor multiplicity was positively correlated with dietary folic acid levels (r = 0.32; P = 0.002) and inversely with plasma homocysteine concentrations (r = -0.32; P = 0.005). Tumor burden was positively correlated with dietary folic acid levels (r = 0.35; P = 0.001) and plasma folate concentrations (r = 0.33; P = 0.008) and inversely with plasma homocysteine concentrations (r = -0.42; P < 0.001). Rectal epithelial proliferation was positively correlated with dietary folic acid levels (r = 0.39; P < 0.001) and plasma folate concentrations (r = 0.34; P < 0.001) and inversely with plasma homocysteine concentrations (r = -0.37; P < 0.001). Our data suggest that folic acid supplementation may promote the progression of ACF to colorectal tumors.},

@article{Mason2007,
	abstract = {Nationwide fortification of enriched uncooked cereal grains with folic acid began in the United States and Canada in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and became mandatory in 1998. The rationale was to reduce the number of births complicated by neural tube defects. Concurrently, the United States and Canada experienced abrupt reversals of the downward trend in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence that the two countries had enjoyed in the preceding decade: absolute rates of CRC began to increase in 1996 (United States) and 1998 (Canada), peaked in 1998 (United States) and 2000 (Canada), and have continued to exceed the pre-1996/1997 trends by 4 to 6 additional cases per 100,000 individuals. In each country, the increase in CRC incidence from the prefortification trend falls significantly outside of the downward linear fit based on nonparametric 95% confidence intervals. The statistically significant increase in rates is also evident when the data for each country are analyzed separately for men and women. Changes in the rate of colorectal endoscopic procedures do not seem to account for this increase in CRC incidence. These observations alone do not prove causality but are consistent with the known effects of folate on existing neoplasms, as shown in both preclinical and clinical studies. We therefore hypothesize that the institution of folic acid fortification may have been wholly or partly responsible for the observed increase in CRC rates in the mid-1990s. Further work is needed to definitively establish the nature of this relationship. In the meantime, deliberations about the institution or enhancement of fortification programs should be undertaken with these considerations in mind.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This is a systematic review to assess published scientific evidence on preterm birth predictors. METHODS: An Internet search for predictors of preterm birth was performed and the evidence level of each method was evaluated. RESULTS: There is strong evidence that preterm birth can be predicted using vaginal sonography to evaluate cervical characteristics, fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions and interleukin-6 in amniotic fluid. There is consistent evidence that digital cervical examination is a weak predictor, and controversy regarding home uterine activity monitoring. There is scanty evidence about the predictive ability of maternal history and perceptions of symptoms since the study design fails to provide high evidence level. CONCLUSION: Cervical evaluation by vaginal sonography, fetal fibronectin and interleukin-6 are the best methods for predicting preterm birth.},

STUDY DESIGN: Women with prior spontaneous preterm birth less than 34 weeks were screened for short cervix and randomly assigned to cerclage if cervical length was less than 25 mm. RESULTS: Of 1014 women screened, 302 were randomized; 42% of women not assigned and 32% of those assigned to cerclage delivered less than 35 weeks (P = .09). In planned analyses, birth less than 24 weeks (P = .03) and perinatal mortality (P = .046) were less frequent in the cerclage group. There was a significant interaction between cervical length and cerclage. Birth less than 35 weeks (P = .006) was reduced in the less than 15 mm stratum with a null effect in the 15-24 mm stratum. CONCLUSION: In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth less than 34 weeks and cervical length less than 25 mm, cerclage reduced previable birth and perinatal mortality but did not prevent birth less than 35 weeks, unless cervical length was less than 15 mm.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women who have had a spontaneous preterm delivery are at greatly increased risk for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies. The results of several small trials have suggested that 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) may reduce the risk of preterm delivery. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving pregnant women with a documented history of spontaneous preterm delivery. Women were enrolled at 19 clinical centers at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and randomly assigned by a central data center, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either weekly injections of 250 mg of 17P or weekly injections of an inert oil placebo; injections were continued until delivery or to 36 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Base-line characteristics of the 310 women in the progesterone group and the 153 women in the placebo group were similar. Treatment with 17P significantly reduced the risk of delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation (incidence, 36.3 percent in the progesterone group vs. 54.9 percent in the placebo group; relative risk, 0.66 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.81]), delivery at less than 35 weeks of gestation (incidence, 20.6 percent vs. 30.7 percent; relative risk, 0.67 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.93]), and delivery at less than 32 weeks of gestation (11.4 percent vs. 19.6 percent; relative risk, 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.91]). Infants of women treated with 17P had significantly lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and need for supplemental oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly injections of 17P resulted in a substantial reduction in the rate of recurrent preterm delivery among women who were at particularly high risk for preterm delivery and reduced the likelihood of several complications in their infants.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy with which a cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin test predicts spontaneous preterm birth in women with or without symptoms of preterm labour. DESIGN: Systematic quantitative review of studies of test accuracy. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, PASCAL, Biosis, Cochrane Library, Medion, National Research Register, SCISEARCH, conference papers, manual searching of bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and contact with experts and manufacturer. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and accuracy. DATA EXTRACTION: Accuracy data were used to form 2x2 contingency tables with spontaneous preterm birth before 34 and 37 weeks' gestation and birth within 7-10 days of testing (for symptomatic pregnant women) as reference standards. Data were pooled to produce summary receiver operating characteristic curves and summary likelihood ratios for positive and negative test results. Data synthesis: 64 primary articles were identified, consisting of 28 studies in asymptomatic women and 40 in symptomatic women, with a total of 26 876 women. Among asymptomatic women the best summary likelihood ratio for positive results was 4.01 (95% confidence interval 2.93 to 5.49) for predicting birth before 34 weeks' gestation, with corresponding summary likelihood ratio for negative results of 0.78 (0.72 to 0.84). Among symptomatic women the best summary likelihood ratio for positive results was 5.42 (4.36 to 6.74) for predicting birth within 7-10 days of testing, with corresponding ratio for negative results of 0.25 (0.20 to 0.31). CONCLUSION: Cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin test is most accurate in predicting spontaneous preterm birth within 7-10 days of testing among women with symptoms of threatened preterm birth before advanced cervical dilatation.},

@article{Gervasi2012,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intra-amniotic inflammation is traditionally defined as an elevation of amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6. Previous case control studies have suggested an association between an elevated midtrimester amniotic fluid IL-6 and preterm delivery, although such an association has been recently challenged. Intra-amniotic inflammation can also be defined by an elevation of the T-cell chemokine, Interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10. An elevation in amniotic fluid IP-10 has been associated with chronic chorioamnionitis, a lesion frequently found in late spontaneous preterm birth and fetal death. In contrast, an elevation in amniotic fluid IL-6 is typically associated with acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis. This study was conducted to examine the relationship between an elevation in amniotic fluid IL-6 in the midtrimester and preterm delivery at or before 32 weeks of gestation, and the amniotic fluid concentration of IP-10 and preterm delivery after 32 weeks of gestation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 847 consecutive women undergoing genetic midtrimester amniocentesis; in 796 cases, amniotic fluid and pregnancy outcome was available for study after exclusion of abnormal karyotype and/or fetal congenital anomalies. Spontaneous preterm delivery was defined as early (</=32 weeks) or late (after 32 completed weeks of pregnancy). The amniotic fluid and maternal blood concentrations of IL-6 and IP-10 were measured by specific immunoassays. RESULTS: 1) The prevalence of preterm delivery was 8.3% (66/796), while those of early and late spontaneous preterm delivery were 1.5% (n=12), and 4.5% (n=36), respectively; 2) patients who had a spontaneous preterm delivery after 32 weeks of gestation had a higher median amniotic fluid IP-10 concentration than those who delivered at term [median 713 pg/mL, inter-quartile range (IQR) 509-1427 pg/mL vs. median 589 pg/mL, IQR 402-953 pg/mL; P=0.006] and an elevation of amniotic fluid IP-10 concentration above 502 pg/mL (derived from an ROC curve) was associated with late spontaneous preterm delivery [odds ratio 3.9 (95% CI 1.6-9.9)]; 3) patients who had a spontaneous preterm delivery </=32 weeks of gestation had a higher median amniotic fluid IL-6 concentration than those who delivered at term [median 2052 pg/mL, IQR 435-3015 pg/mL vs. median 414 pg/mL, IQR 209-930 pg/mL; P=0.006], and an elevated amniotic fluid IL-6 concentration above 1740 pg/mL (derived from an ROC curve) was associated with early spontaneous preterm delivery [odds ratio 9.5 (95% CI 2.9-31.1)]; 4) subclinical intra-amniotic inflammation, defined as an elevation of IL-6 (>/=2.9 ng/mL) or IP-10 (>/=2.2 ng/mL) concentration above the 95th percentile of patients who had uncomplicated term delivery (n=652 for IL-6 and n=633 for IP-10), was observed in 6.3% (50/796) and 5.8% (45/770) of cases, respectively. Although each type of inflammation is a risk factor for spontaneous preterm delivery, many patients had a term delivery without complication; 5) the amniotic fluid in the midtrimester did not contain microorganisms detectable with cultivation techniques. CONCLUSIONS: INTRA-amniotic inflammation is heterogeneous. Some patients have elevated amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-6, and are at risk for spontaneous preterm delivery before 32 weeks of gestation, while others have an elevated IP-10 (a chemotactic T-cell chemokine) and such patients are at risk for spontaneous preterm delivery after 32 weeks of gestation. A fraction of patients have subclinical intra-amniotic inflammation and deliver at term. The clinical significance of this condition remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop classification models of demographic/clinical factors and biomarker data from spontaneous preterm birth in African Americans and Caucasians. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of biomarker data using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a supervised machine learning algorithm method. SETTING: Analysis of data on 36 biomarkers from 191 women was reduced by MARS to develop predictive models for preterm birth in African Americans and Caucasians. SAMPLES: Maternal plasma, cord plasma collected at admission for preterm or term labor and amniotic fluid at delivery. METHODS: Data were partitioned into training and testing sets. Variable importance, a relative indicator (0-100%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) characterized results. RESULTS: Multivariate adaptive regression splines generated models for combined and racially stratified biomarker data. Clinical and demographic data did not contribute to the model. Racial stratification of data produced distinct models in all three compartments. In African Americans maternal plasma samples IL-1RA, TNF-alpha, angiopoietin 2, TNFRI, IL-5, MIP1alpha, IL-1beta and TGF-alpha modeled preterm birth (AUC train: 0.98, AUC test: 0.86). In Caucasians TNFR1, ICAM-1 and IL-1RA contributed to the model (AUC train: 0.84, AUC test: 0.68). African Americans cord plasma samples produced IL-12P70, IL-8 (AUC train: 0.82, AUC test: 0.66). Cord plasma in Caucasians modeled IGFII, PDGFBB, TGF-beta1 , IL-12P70, and TIMP1 (AUC train: 0.99, AUC test: 0.82). Amniotic fluid in African Americans modeled FasL, TNFRII, RANTES, KGF, IGFI (AUC train: 0.95, AUC test: 0.89) and in Caucasians, TNF-alpha, MCP3, TGF-beta3 , TNFR1 and angiopoietin 2 (AUC train: 0.94 AUC test: 0.79).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study were to explore whether the maternal-fetal outcomes differed among various types of hyperglycemia during pregnancy and whether the values of glycemic screening in the middle phase of pregnancy could predict maternal-fetal outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to study the incidence of maternal-fetal outcomes in 383 singleton pregnant women with diabetes or gestational diabetes admitted to our hospital from November 2007 to March 2013. Patients were divided into three groups: DM (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus) group, mGDM (mild gestational diabetes mellitus) group and sGDM (severe gestational diabetes mellitus) group. Maternal basic characteristics, results of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), antenatal random glycemia and maternal-fetal outcomes were collected. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the association of blood glucose with the maternal-fetal outcomes. Predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The maternal basic characteristics, maternal complications and neonatal complications did not differ significantly between DM group and sGDM group, except neonatal intensive care units admission (NICU). Incidences of preterm, NICU and preeclampsia were significantly lower in the mGDM group than in the DM and sGDM groups (P < 0.05). After adjusted by confounding factors, the value of OGTT 0 h could predict pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) (OR = 1.24, 95% CI [1.04 to 1.46], P = 0.015), preterm birth (OR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.03 to 1.47], P = 0.025) and stillbirth (OR = 1.55, 95% CI [1.14 to 2.10], P = 0.005); antenatal random glycemia could predict preterm birth (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.08 to 1.31], P < 0.001) and stillbirth (OR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.17 to 1.71], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women in the mGDM group have better outcomes than those in the DM and sGDM groups. The values of OGTT in the middle phase of pregnancy and antenatal random glycemia could predict PIH, preterm birth or stillbirth to some extent.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective: Accurate prediction of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is essential to target interventions. Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is a leading predictor. A quantitative fFN (qfFN) test has improved prediction, based on high vaginal swabs (HVS). It is not known how endocervical (ECS) fFN levels compare, or which has the best predictive value. Our principal aim was to determine the difference in fFN concentration between HVS and ECS and compare their ability to predict sPTB. Methods: Asymptomatic high risk women (18+0-30+0 weeks gestation) had secretions sampled from the endocervix (ECS) and vaginal fornix (HVS), analyzed by the quantitative fFN analyzer (Hologic). Mean concentrations were compared; ROC curves were calculated using area under the curve (AUC) for prediction of delivery <30 and 37 weeks. Results: Mean HVS value was lower than ECS (80 ng/ml (SD142) versus 217 (SD 212) (p < 0.05). Predictive ability was similar: AUC of 0.92 and 0.94, respectively, for prediction of sPTB < 37 and 0.84 and 0.82 for <30 weeks. Conclusions: Endocervical qfFN is higher than HVS and clinicians should avoid ECS if using traditional thresholds. ECS and HVS are both useful predictors, but require different threshold values. Further work is needed to determine whether ECS is a better and safe test to justify the difficulty in sampling.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Abnormal maternal serum analytes (pregnancy associated plasma protein A, total human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha fetoprotein, Inhibin A, and unconjugated estriol) measured as part of aneuploidy screening programs have been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes in euploid pregnancies. This study aimed to determine if their predictive ability could be enhanced with additional information on obstetrical history. METHOD: Forty-five thousand two hundred eighty-seven women participated in the screening program and delivered euploid singleton infants between 2010 and 2012 in British Columbia, Canada. A split-sample design was used to develop and validate prognostic models for serious perinatal events (stillbirth, preterm birth <32 weeks, or HELLP syndrome) and severe pre-eclampsia [pre-eclampsia with preterm birth <34 weeks or small for gestational age <10th percentile] using logistic regression. RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred four women (7.7%) had at least one abnormal marker using standard cut-off values. The combination of serum markers and clinical risk factors improved the ability of statistical models to predict a serious perinatal event [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.62] and severe pre-eclampsia (AUC = 0.78) compared with serum markers or clinical risk factors alone. CONCLUSIONS: While detection rates are low, the combination of maternal serum markers and obstetrical history helps to identify a small subset of women at higher risk for serious perinatal events and severe pre-eclampsia.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio levels in the first trimester of pregnancy, their association with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and their predictive accuracy. STUDY DESIGN: This cohort study measured serum Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels in 4785 women with singleton pregnancies attending first trimester screening in New South Wales, Australia. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association and predictive accuracy of serum biomarkers with subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes (small for gestational age, preterm birth, preeclampsia, miscarriage >10 weeks, and stillbirth). RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) levels for Ang-1, Ang-2, and the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio for the total population were 19.6 ng/mL (13.6-26.4), 15.5 ng/mL (10.3-22.7), and 1.21 (0.83-1.73), respectively. Maternal age, weight, country of birth, and socioeconomic status significantly affected Ang-1, Ang-2, and the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio levels. After adjusting for maternal and clinical risk factors, women with low Ang-2 levels (<10th percentile) and high Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio (>90th percentile) had increased risk of developing most adverse pregnancy outcomes. Compared with the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio alone, maternal and clinical risk factors had better predictive accuracy for most adverse pregnancy outcomes. The exception was miscarriage (Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.70; maternal risk factors = 0.58). Overall, adding the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio to maternal risk factors did not improve the ability of the models to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio in first trimester is associated with most adverse pregnancy outcomes, but do not predict outcomes any better than clinical and maternal risk factor information.},

@article{Fergus2013,
	abstract = {There has been some improvement in the treatment of preterm infants, which has helped to increase their chance of survival. However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants are most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. In extreme cases, this can also lead to long-term conditions, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning difficulties, including poor health and growth. In the US alone, the societal and economic cost of preterm births, in 2005, was estimated to be $26.2 billion, per annum. In the UK, this value was close to pound2.95 billion, in 2009. Many believe that a better understanding of why preterm births occur, and a strategic focus on prevention, will help to improve the health of children and reduce healthcare costs. At present, most methods of preterm birth prediction are subjective. However, a strong body of evidence suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals (Electrohysterography), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and predict preterm deliveries. Most Electrohysterography studies focus on true labour detection during the final seven days, before labour. The challenge is to utilise Electrohysterography techniques to predict preterm delivery earlier in the pregnancy. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies term and preterm records, using an open source dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to oversample the minority preterm class, and cross validation techniques, are used to evaluate the dataset against other similar studies. Our approach shows an improvement on existing studies with 96% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and a 95% area under the curve value with 8% global error using the polynomial classifier.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, causes preterm birth in animals and has been implicated as a factor triggering preterm labor and systemic complications in humans. Little is known regarding LPS in the cord blood (CB) of term and preterm infants and its association with maternal and fetal characteristics. METHODS: CB was obtained from term (n = 15) and preterm infants (n = 76) after delivery. Plasma levels of LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14) were measured using commercially available kits (limulus amebocyte lysate and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Four linear regression models were created in order to identify independent variables that predict plasma LPS levels. RESULTS: The analyte levels were significantly higher in preterm vs. term infant CB: LPS (24.48 vs. 1 pg/ml; P = 0.0009), CRP (87.9 vs. 47 ng/ml; P = 0.01), and sCD14 (0.32 vs.0.35 microg/ml; P = 0.013). There was a (significant) positive correlation between CB LPS levels and gestational age, birth weight, CRP levels, sCD14 levels, and association with both clinical and histological chorioamnionitis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that LPS is associated with preterm labor and inflammation (CRP elevation and chorioamnionitis). These findings may be relevant to the understanding of the role of LPS in prematurity and its role in preterm morbidities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of a woman's risk of a spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD) is a core challenge and an unresolved problem in today's obstetric practice. The objective of this study was to develop prediction models for spontaneous PTD (<37 weeks). METHODS: A population-based register study of women born in Sweden with spontaneous onset of delivery was designed using Swedish Medical Birth Register data for 1992-2008. Predictive variables were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis, and outputs were used to calculate adjusted likelihood ratios in primiparous (n = 199 272) and multiparous (n = 249 580) singleton pregnant women. The predictive ability of each model was validated in a separate test sample for primiparous (n = 190 936) and multiparous (n = 239 203) women, respectively. RESULTS: For multiparous women, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73, 0.74] indicated a satisfying performance of the model, while for primiparous women, it was rather poor {AUC: 0.58 [95% CI 0.57, 0.58]}. For both primiparous and multiparous women, the prediction models were quite good for pregnancies with comparatively low risk for spontaneous PTD, whereas more limited to predict pregnancies with >/=30% risk of spontaneous PTD. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous PTD is difficult to predict in multiparous women and nearly impossible in primiparous, by using this statistical method in a large and unselected sample. However, adding clinical data (like cervical length) may in the future further improve its predictive performance.},

@article{Deshpande2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Premature birth is defined as birth of before 37 completed weeks' gestation. Not all pregnant women showing symptoms of preterm labour will go on to deliver before 37 weeks' gestation. Hence, addition of fetal fibronectin (fFN) testing to the diagnostic workup of women with suspected preterm labour may help to identify those women who do not require active management, and thus avoid unnecessary interventions, hospitalisations and associated costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of rapid fFN testing in predicting preterm birth (PTB) in symptomatic women. DATA SOURCES: Bibliographic databases (including EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched from 2000 to September/November 2011. Trial registers were also searched. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review methods followed published guidance; we assessed clinical effectiveness and updated a previous systematic review of test accuracy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool (randomised controlled trials; RCTs) and a modification of QUADAS-2 (diagnostic test accuracy studies; DTAs). Summary risk ratios or weighted mean difference were calculated using random-effects models. Summary sensitivity and specificity used a bivariate summary receiver operating characteristic model. Heterogeneity was investigated using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Health economic analysis focused on cost consequences. The time horizon was hospital admission for observation. A main structural assumption was that, compared with usual care, fFN testing doesn't increase adverse events or negative pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Five RCTs and 15 new DTAs were identified. No RCT reported significant effects of fFN testing on maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a subgroup analysis of women with negative fFN test observed > 6 hours, which showed a reduction in length of hospital stay where results were known to clinicians. Combining data from new studies and the previous systematic review, the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were: 76.7% and 82.7% for delivery within 7-10 days of testing; 69.1% and 84.4% for delivery < 34 weeks' gestation; and 60.8% and 82.3% for delivery < 37 weeks' gestation. Estimates were similar across all subgroups sensitivity analyses. The base-case cost analysis resulted in a cost saving of pound23.87 for fFN testing compared with usual care. The fFN testing was cost-neutral at an approximate cost of pound45. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis gave an incremental cost (saving) of - pound25.59 (97.5% confidence interval - pound304.96 to pound240.06), indicating substantial uncertainty. Sensitivity analyses indicated that admission rate had the largest impact on results. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal fibronectin testing has moderate accuracy for predicting PTB. The main potential role is likely to be reducing health-care resource usage by identifying women not requiring intervention. Evidence from RCTs suggests that fFN does not increase adverse outcomes and may reduce resource use. The base-case analysis showed a modest cost difference in favour of fFN testing, which is largely dependent on whether or not fFN testing reduces hospital admission. Currently, there are no high-quality studies and the existing trials were generally underpowered. Hence, there is a need for high-quality adequately powered trials using appropriate study designs to confirm the findings presented. STUDY REGISTRATION: PROSPERO 2011:CRD42011001468.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether biomarkers from different pathways of spontaneous preterm birth (cervical membrane degradation [fetal fibronectin], cervical remodeling [soluble E-cadherin], and inflammation (elafin, surfactant protein-D, interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were superior to one biomarker alone in predicting preterm birth. Our secondary objective was to examine the association of these biomarkers with cervical length in predicting preterm birth. METHODS: We performed a single-center, prospective cohort study from August 2011 to November 2012 of asymptomatic women at risk for spontaneous preterm birth as a result of obstetric and gynecologic history. Cervicovaginal fluid and cervical length measurements were collected at two time points (20-23 6/7 weeks and 24-27 6/7 weeks of gestation). RESULTS: Among the 104 women with complete data, the preterm birth rate was 24.5%. Prior preterm birth (P=.006) and cervical length at visit 1 (P=.003) were significantly associated with preterm birth, whereas fetal fibronectin and median biomarker levels (elafin, soluble E-cadherin, IL-6) were not. Median surfactant protein-D levels at visit 1 by preterm birth status were statistically but not clinically different (0.44 ng/mL compared with 0.40 ng/mL, P<.001). Analyses of biomarkers from more than one pathway were not superior to single biomarker analyses in predicting prematurity. Neither inclusion of biomarkers nor fetal fibronectin improved the predictive ability of cervical length alone. CONCLUSION: Cervical length assessment and obstetric history but not fetal fibronectin or biomarkers were useful in the risk stratification of women identified to be at greatest risk for spontaneous preterm birth.

Existing diagnostic tests such as transvaginal ultrasound or fetal fibronectin either cannot determine if preterm birth will occur in the future or can only predict the occurrence once cervical shortening has begun, at which point it is too late to reverse the accelerated parturition process. Using iterative and rapid prototyping techniques, we have developed an intravaginal proof-of-concept device that measures both cervical bioimpedance and cervical fluorescence to characterize microstructural changes in a pregnant woman's cervix in hopes of detecting preterm birth before macroscopic changes manifest in the tissue.

	abstract = {The ability to recognise women who are at-risk of preterm labour (PTL) is often difficult. Over 50% of women who are identified with factors associated with an increased risk of preterm birth will ultimately deliver at term. The cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) comprises a range of proteins secreted by gestational tissues, making it an ideal candidate for the screening of differentially expressed proteins associated with PTL. CVF samples were collected from at-risk asymptomatic women. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis techniques were used to examine the CVF proteome of women who spontaneously delivered preterm 11-22 days later compared with gestation-matched women who delivered at term. Five candidate biomarkers were selected for further validation in a larger independent cohort of asymptomatic women. Thioredoxin (TXN) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) concentrations in the CVF were found to be significantly reduced up to 90 days prior to spontaneous PTL compared with women who subsequently delivered at term. TXN was able to predict spontaneous PTL within 28 days after sampling with a high positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 75.0% and 96.4% respectively. IL1RN also showed comparable PPV and NPV of 72.7% and 95.7% respectively. The discovery of these differentially expressed proteins may assist in the development of a new predictive bedside test in identifying asymptomatic women who have an increased risk of spontaneous PTL.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between first trimester maternal serum soluble HLA-G1/G5 levels and high-risk pregnancies. A total of 232 pregnant women were followed prospectively. Maternal blood samples were collected for determination of soluble HLA-G1/G5 levels at 11-14 weeks, during which routine serum free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betahCG) and pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) level determinations in addition to nuchal translucency (NT) measurements for Down's syndrome screening were done during 20-22 weeks gestation. The subjects were classified into normal pregnancy, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, IUGR, preterm birth and PROM groups. First trimester maternal serum soluble HLA-G1/G5 levels were not significantly different between the groups. First trimester soluble HLA-G1/G5 did not predict high-risk pregnancies. Studies with larger number of cases are need to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {Objective. The aim of this study was to assess whether cervical length measurement (CL) could predict preterm birth (PTB) in symptomatic women with a twin pregnancy. Methods. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify studies investigating the accuracy of CL measurement in predicting PTB in symptomatic women with a twin pregnancy. We extracted data to construct two-by-two tables and used bivariate meta-analysis to generate point estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Results. Five studies (N = 226) were included. Variation in definition of PTB and cut-off points for CL was strong. One study investigated delivery within seven days, demonstrating a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.83-1.0) and a specificity of 0.31 (95% CI 0.2-0.43) for a CL cutoff at 25 mm. Three studies reported on predicting PTB < 37 weeks at a CL cutoff of 30 mm, with sROC point estimates of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66 to 0.84) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.21 to 0.56) for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. For preterm birth <34 weeks, no pooled estimates could be estimated since only 2 studies with large heterogeneity were identified. Conclusions. There is limited evidence on the accuracy of cervical length measurement testing the prediction of preterm birth in symptomatic women with a twin pregnancy, especially on the most important outcome, that is, delivery within 7 days.},

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of qualitative and quantitative assay of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in cervicovaginal secretion as a biochemical predictor of preterm birth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at Ain-Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. A total of 390 pregnant women were included in the statistical analysis: 90 women who presented with threatened preterm labor and 300 asymptomatic pregnant women with matched age, gestational age, bodyweight, parity and obstetric history. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of cervicovaginal fluid hCG at 26-36 weeks of gestation were performed to assess the risk for preterm birth. RESULTS: In women with threatened preterm labor (group 1) and asymptomatic pregnant women (group 2), preterm birth occurred in 35.6% and 9.3%, respectively. We analyzed predictive performances of qualitative and quantitative assay of hCG in cervicovaginal secretion, while combining group 1 and group 2. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of qualitative test, by the cut-off level of 25 mIU/mL, to predict preterm birth were 68.3%, 96.1%, 76.9%, 94.3% and 91.8%, respectively; those of quantitative test, by the cut-off level of 34.5 mIU/mL, were 100%, 98.5%, 92.3%, 100% and 98.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both the qualitative and quantitative assessment of cervicovaginal fluid hCG at 26-36 weeks of gestation were valuable in the prediction of occurrence of preterm birth in the women who presented with threatened preterm labor as well as in the asymptomatic pregnant population.},

@article{Borg2013,
	abstract = {Preterm delivery is birth occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation. Preterm birth is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in children especially if this occurs before 34 weeks of gestation. If preterm birth could be predicted and treated accordingly, this would greatly reduce mortality, morbidity and associated costs. There have been many attempts to develop an accurate and efficient method to predict preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and preterm labor that leads to spontaneous preterm birth (SPB). However, the initial signs and symptoms are most often mild and may even occur in normal pregnancies, making early detection rather difficult. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current methods employed in predicting preterm birth occurring due to preterm labor and PPROM. Among these methods are risk scoring systems, cervical/vaginal screening for fetal fibronectin, cervical assessment by ultrasonography, uterine activity monitoring, biomarkers such as endocrine factors, cytokines and enzymes, fetal DNA and genetic polymorphism. SPB is multifactorial, and so it is highly unlikely that a single test can accurately predict SPB. A combination of biological markers is also reviewed in the estimation of the risk of preterm delivery.},

On the other hand, twin pregnancy increases rate of preterm delivery, so this study was designed to evaluate the transvaginal sonographic (TVS) measurement of cervical length (CL) to predict preterm birth in twin pregnancy. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was performed on 80 twin pregnant women whom the length and funneling of their cervix were evaluated between 22-24 gestational weeks by (TVS). They referred to us at the early signs of labor. Then the gestational age at delivery was recorded. The Fisher exact test and the odds-ratio was used to determine the association between CL and SPD. RESULTS: Thirty-four (42.5%) women had SPD. Cervical funneling happened in 7.5% of cases and SPD occurred in all women with funneling. There was a significant correlation between CL </= 30 mm and SPD (66.7% versus 35.5%, p = 0.029) Also, the risk of SPD was enhanced 3.6 times with CL </= 30 mm, CI 95% (1.1-11). CONCLUSION: We recommend TVS for assessment of CL between 22-24 weeks for prediction of SPD in twin pregnancy.},

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Biochemistry at UCMS & GTBH, Delhi, India. SAMPLE: Ninety pregnant women. METHODS: The progesterone concentration in saliva of asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery was estimated by immunoassay, and cervical length was measured by TVS, at the first antenatal visit at 24-28 weeks of gestation, and then repeated 3-4 weeks later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early PTB, mean and critical cut-off values of salivary progesterone, and a diagnostic value comparison of salivary progesterone with TVS cervical length. RESULTS: The mean value of salivary progesterone was significantly lower in all women who delivered at <37 weeks of gestation (n = 38), compared with the term group (n = 52; P < 0.001). Salivary progesterone decreased significantly from the first to the second visit, with the maximum decrease observed in women who delivered at <34 weeks of gestation (29.6%, 95% CI 17.8-41.4%, P < 0.002). The single predictive critical cut-off value for salivary progesterone was 2575 pg/ml, below which more than 80% of women delivered prematurely before 34 weeks of gestation, with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 83% (95% CI 58.6-96.4%), 86% (95% CI 75.9-93.1%), 60% (95% CI 38.6-78.8%) and 95% (95% CI 87.1-99.0%), respectively. The TVS cervical length decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in the women who delivered prematurely. CONCLUSIONS: Low salivary progesterone concentration can be used for predicting early PTB in asymptomatic high-risk women.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to create a predictive model for preterm birth (PTB) from available clinical data and serum analytes. STUDY DESIGN: Serum analytes and routine pregnancy screening plus cholesterol and corresponding health information were linked to birth certificate data for a cohort of 2699 Iowa women with serum sampled in the first and second trimester. Stepwise logistic regression was used to select the best predictive model for PTB. RESULTS: Serum screening markers remained significant predictors of PTB, even after controlling for maternal characteristics. The best predictive model included maternal characteristics, first-trimester total cholesterol, total cholesterol change between trimesters, and second-trimester alpha-fetoprotein and inhibin A. The model showed better discriminatory ability than PTB history alone and performed similarly in subgroups of women without past PTB. CONCLUSION: Using clinical and serum screening data, a potentially useful predictor of PTB was constructed. Validation and replication in other populations, and incorporation of other measures that identify PTB risk, like cervical length, can be a step toward identifying additional women who may benefit from new or currently available interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study vaginal fluid phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (phIGFBP-1) testing in early pregnancy to predict spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD). METHODS: Vaginal and cervical swab samples were collected from 5180 unselected women during the first-trimester (mean gestational age 13.1 weeks) ultrasound screening. PhIGFBP-1 was measured in vaginal and cervical fluid by an immunoenzymometric assay. Concentrations of >/=10 microg/L were considered elevated. The outcome measure was spontaneous PTD at <32 or <37 weeks gestation. RESULTS: The median concentrations of first-trimester vaginal and cervical phIGFBP-1 were higher in women with spontaneous PTD at <32 and <37 weeks gestation. When 10 microg/L of phIGFBP-1 was used as a cut-off level, the OR in predicting PTD at <32 weeks gestation was 8.6 (95% CI 3.6-20.7) for vaginal samples and 3.6 (95% CI 1.7-7.9) for cervical samples. At <37 weeks gestation, the OR in predicting PTD was 3.0 (95% CI 1.9-3.9) for vaginal samples and 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.5) for cervical samples. In multiple logistic regression analysis, both elevated vaginal and cervical fluid phIGFBP-1 levels were independent predictors of PTD both at <32 and <37 weeks gestation. CONCLUSION: First-trimester vaginal phIGFBP-1 performed better than cervical phIGFBP-1 in the prediction of spontaneous PTD.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm birth and preeclampsia have been discovered in patients who experience these adverse obstetrical outcomes. The identification of such biomarkers holds promise in both facilitating the early identification of those patients at greatest risk and enhancing our understanding of these disease processes to determine therapeutic interventions. To that end, our objective was to review the existing literature to determine the utility of biomarkers in the risk stratification of spontaneous preterm birth and preeclampsia. We found that despite the promise of some biomarkers in identifying patients at increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth and/or preeclampsia, the use of biomarkers in clinical practice to predict adverse obstetrical outcome remains challenging. Although data from small discovery studies may be encouraging, progress with biomarker research remains limited by the lack of validation of these discovered biomarkers. Furthermore, owing to the heterogeneity of existing studies, generalizable conclusions are difficult to understand, meta-analyses are challenging to perform, and agreement on cut-point standardization is difficult. The identification of an abnormal biomarker level does not guarantee whether or when an adverse clinical event might occur. Our lack of understanding of the true etiologies of these disease processes leaves us without definitive interventions to prevent spontaneous preterm birth and preeclampsia from occurring.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While increased disease activity is the best predictor of preterm birth in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), even women with low disease activity are at increased risk of this complication. Biomarkers that would identify at-risk pregnancies could allow interventions to prevent preterm birth. METHOD: Measures of SLE activity, inflammation, placental health and renal function between 20 and 28 weeks gestation (mid-gestation) were correlated to preterm birth and gestational age at delivery in a prospective cohort of pregnant women with SLE. RESULT: Of the 40 pregnancies in 39 women, all with mild-moderate SLE disease, 9 (23.7%) of the 38 live births were delivered preterm. Low C4 was the only marker of SLE activity associated with younger gestational age at delivery. Elevated ferritin and lower oestradiol correlated with younger gestational age at delivery. Renal function remained normal during all pregnancies at mid-gestation and did not correlate with preterm birth. Higher serum uric acid, however, correlated with younger gestational age at delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In women with SLE with mild-moderate disease activity, ferritin, oestradiol and uric acid levels at mid-gestation may predict preterm birth. These markers may prove to be clinically useful in identifying pregnancies at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The closure of rural maternity units in Australia means an increasing number of women are transferred into major centres to await birth. Accurately excluding the onset of labour could delay relocation. The fetal fibronectin (fFN) test is used to predict preterm birth; however, the accuracy of this test for determining impending term birth is unclear. METHODS: 75 women were recruited to this study from<strong> </strong>two remote maternity units. Eligibility criteria were: aged &&num;8805;18 years, singleton pregnancy, 37+0-40+3 weeks (37 weeks to 40 weeks and 3 days gestation) and no indication for induction of labour or caesarean section in next 7 days. The Quikcheck fFN(R) test was performed at 37 weeks and then repeated at 7 day intervals. Time-to-birth from test date was modelled using linear regression. Logistic regression models estimated odds of birth within 7 days. Separate models considered first and last test results and those at 38 weeks; adjusted for use of lubricant and gestational age. RESULTS: A shorter time-to-birth was found in women with positive compared with negative fFN tests; significant at first fFN test (adjusted mean difference [AMD] 5.4 days, 95% CI 2.0-8.8) and 38 weeks (AMD 5.7 days, 95% CI 2.2-9.2 days). A positive test was also associated with a significant increase in the odds of birthing within 7 days: first fFN test adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 11.0 (95% CI 2.5-48.7), 38 weeks test AOR 14.4 (95% CI 3.4-60.2), last fFN test AOR 8.1 (95% CI 1.6-39.8). However, of women who gave birth within 7 days of testing a significant proportion had a negative fFN result; first fFN test 8/17(47.1%), 38 weeks test 4/14(28.6%) and last fFN test 29/58(50.0%). CONCLUSION: The presence of fFN in cervical secretions was associated with impending term birth but its absence did not reliably exclude the onset of birth. Delaying transfer based on these findings would result in some women birthing in their home communities.},

The objective of RTE is to investigate stiffness and related parameters such as local tissue strain with a view to adding new information related to tissue morphology and architecture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a pilot study in 12 healthy pregnant women who underwent transvaginal ultrasound. The RTE (Hitachi) information was colour-coded and superimposed on the B-mode scan. Elastography images were analyzed by means of a software tool to identify thresholds for the colours red (soft), green (medium hard) and blue (hard). The cervical strain rate was measured in three different parts. Additional information obtained included age of gestation, number of pregnancies and deliveries, previous preterm births and gestational age at delivery in current pregnancy. RESULTS: The softness of cervix increases towards portio. Within the colour spectrum, green was predominant. Strain ratio can be used as a comparative index among different subjects rather than as an absolute strain measurement. CONCLUSION: The elastographic image allowed for easy correlation between colour distribution and the anatomical structures as it is superimposed on the B-mode image. The elasticity of the cervix increases towards portio. FUNDING: Not relevant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not relevant.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if fetal volume (FV) measurements with three-dimensional ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy can detect the fetus at risk for preterm birth and/or low birth weight. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 538 participants were included during the routine first trimester ultrasound examination. Volume measurements were performed with VOCAL (9 degrees ). Firstly, the relation between FV and gestational age for a set of participants with normal pregnancies (training set), was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis, which was then used to determine the expected normal values. Secondly, for a new set of participants with normal pregnancies and a set of participants with complicated pregnancies (preterm birth and/or low birth weight), i.e. the validation set, the observed fetal volumes (FVobserved) were compared with their expected normal values (FVexpected) and expressed as a percentage of the expected normal value. The difference in mean percentage was then assessed with independent-samples t-test. Finally, logistic regression analysis was applied to the validation set to analyze the ability to predict the pregnancy outcome with FV calculation. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of FV as a predictor of preterm birth and/or low birth weight did not result in significant (p=0.630 and 0.290, respectively) or clinical relevant results (standardized effect sizes of 0.061 and 0.179, respectively). The predicting quality was also very low (AUC=0.508 and 0.545 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal volume measurements in the first trimester of pregnancy are not useful as a prognostic tool for predicting pregnancies of high risk for preterm birth or a low birth weight.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Markers of placental dysfunction are used for risk prediction of adverse obstetric outcomes including preeclampsia and growth restriction. Although medically indicated preterm birth is often distinguished from spontaneous preterm birth, we hypothesize that similar placental dysfunction may underlay all preterm birth. We aimed to investigate whether first trimester placental protein 13 (PP-13), pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and uterine artery pulsatility index, with maternal characteristics could be used to predict all preterm birth. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of singleton gestations between 11 and 14 weeks who underwent serum measurement of PP-13, PAPP-A, and measurement of uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index. Primary outcomes were preterm birth (PTB) at less than 37 and 33 weeks. Analysis performed both including and excluding preeclampsia to assess the utility of the predictors for all types of preterm birth. Predictive models assembled using logistic regression with each predictor alone and in combination, along with maternal characteristics. Predictive utility of models was assessed using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and sensitivities for fixed false positive values. RESULTS: Of 471 women, PTB occurred in 12.5% and early PTB (<33 weeks) occurred in 4.7%. PP-13 was decreased in PTB <37 weeks. PAPP-A was decreased in a dose-response pattern for PTB at <37 weeks and <33 weeks. Uterine artery pulsatility index was increased in early PTB. All patterns of predictors remained the same whether patients with preeclampsia were excluded or included suggesting predictive utility for all causes of PTB. Predictive models all demonstrated good predictive ability with ROC >/= 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: PP-13, PAPP-A, and uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index obtained in the first trimester are good predictors of all types of preterm birth, both indicated and spontaneous. Models including first trimester markers combined with maternal characteristics demonstrated good predictive ability and could be investigated for application of targeted prophylactic strategies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine whether an association exists between maternal leukocyte count in the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk for development of obstetric complications. METHODS: The study population included all the registered births (n = 33,866) with available white blood cell count (WBC) from the first trimester of pregnancy, during 2000-2010 in a tertiary medical center. The leukocyte count was sorted by the following groups: WBC < 3.5 10 x 9/l, WBC = 3.5 10 x 9/l-13.8 10 x 9/l, and WBC > 13.8 10 x 9/l. These groups were compared regarding obstetrical characteristics and perinatal outcomes. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders. RESULTS: The study population included 33,866 deliveries, of these 0.94 % had leukocytosis WBC > 13.8 10 x 9/l. Women with leukocytosis delivered significantly earlier, were more likely to be Jewish, and in their first pregnancy. There were significantly higher rates of preterm delivery before 37 weeks, fertility treatments, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean section among these patients. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and chorioamnionitis. Women with leukocytosis during the first trimester had significantly higher rates of fetuses who were small for gestational age and with birth weight <2,500 g. Multivariable analysis showed a significant association between preterm delivery before 37 weeks and leukocytosis during the first trimester of pregnancy (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Leukocytosis during the first trimester is significantly associated with an increased risk for obstetrical complications, in particular preterm delivery. Nevertheless, further studies should focus on women with leukocytosis during the first trimester in order to verify our results.},

@article{Hsu2013,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Infection is believed to be one of frequent and important causes of preterm labor. We attempted to evaluate whether the level of inflammatory markers, e.g. interleukin-16 (IL-16), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and ferritin, in amniotic fluid at early second trimester can predict preterm birth. METHODS: Amniotic fluid (AF) samples were collected from 350 pregnant women who had trans-abdominal amniocentesis for genetic indications at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation. AF levels of IL-16, IL-18 and ferritin levels were measured by immunoassay and were correlated with pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 350 pregnant women, 58 (16.6%) had preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). AF levels of IL-16, IL-18, and ferritin were significantly higher in pregnant women with subsequent preterm birth. Multivariate analyses showed that a quartile higher of AF IL-16 level was significantly associated with preterm birth (OR: 3.09, 95% CI 1.52-6.27, p = 0.002). A receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an IL-16 cutoff value of 105 pg/ml was a reliable predictor of preterm birth (sensitivity, 90.2%; specificity, 52.7%; negative predictive value, 84.3%). CONCLUSION: It is feasible to predict preterm birth by measuring the AF levels of IL-16 especially for the pregnant women requiring genetic amniocentesis during early second trimester.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth (birth <37 weeks gestation) with intact membranes (SPTB-IM) and SPTB after prelabour rupture of the membranes (SPTB-PPROM) for nulliparous pregnant women. DESIGN: Prospective international multicentre cohort. PARTICIPANTS: 3234 healthy nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy, follow up was complete in 3184 of participants (98.5%). RESULTS: Of the 3184 women, 156 (4.9%) had their pregnancy complicated by SPTB; 96 (3.0%) and 60 (1.9%) in the SPTB-IM and SPTB-PPROM categories, respectively. Independent risk factors for SPTB-IM were shorter cervical length, abnormal uterine Doppler flow, use of marijuana pre-pregnancy, lack of overall feeling of well being, being of Caucasian ethnicity, having a mother with diabetes and/or a history of preeclampsia, and a family history of low birth weight babies. Independent risk factors for SPTB-PPROM were shorter cervical length, short stature, participant's not being the first born in the family, longer time to conceive, not waking up at night, hormonal fertility treatment (excluding clomiphene), mild hypertension, family history of recurrent gestational diabetes, and maternal family history of any miscarriage (risk reduction). Low BMI (<20) nearly doubled the risk for SPTB-PPROM (odds ratio 2.64; 95% CI 1.07-6.51). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), after internal validation, was 0.69 for SPTB-IM and 0.79 for SPTB-PPROM. CONCLUSION: The ability to predict PTB in healthy nulliparous women using clinical characteristics is modest. The dissimilarity of risk factors for SPTB-IM compared with SPTB-PPROM indicates different pathophysiological pathways underlie these distinct phenotypes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study examines whether there is an association between anemia during the first trimester and the risk to develop preterm delivery (PTD), intrauterine growth restriction, and other obstetrical complications. METHODS: The study population included all registered births between 2000 and 2010. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <10 g/dl. A comparison of obstetrical characteristics and perinatal outcomes was performed between women with and without anemia. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders. RESULTS: The study population included 33,888 deliveries, of these 5.1% (1718) were with anemia during the first trimester. Women with anemia were significantly older, delivered earlier, and were more likely to be grand multiparous. There were significantly higher rates of PTD and low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g) among patients with anemia (12.3% vs. 9.3%; p < 0.001 and 11.7% vs. 9.0%; p < 0.001, respectively). On the contrary, no significant differences between the groups were noted regarding the rate of intrauterine growth restriction. Using a multivariable analysis, the significant association between anemia and PTD persisted (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.2-1.6, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia during the first trimester is significantly and independently associated with an increased risk for subsequent PTD.},

@article{Kashanian2013,
	abstract = {AIM: Preterm delivery is a serious problem during pregnancy with remarkable neonatal adverse effects. Prediction of preterm delivery in women with preterm uterine contractions or signs of preterm labor is critical because if these women are identified they can be referred to tertiary centers. The present study aimed to evaluate the value of maternal serum urocortin concentration for predicting preterm delivery in women with signs of spontaneous preterm labor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort study was conducted on pregnant women at a gestational age of 28-36 weeks who were admitted to the labor ward with spontaneous preterm labor. A blood sample was obtained from all participants to measure serum urocortin. The women were monitored up to delivery and serum urocortin was compared between women with preterm delivery and those who delivered at term (37 weeks of gestation). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine sensitivity and specificity if applicable. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty pregnant women finished the study. One hundred and forty-eight (92.5%) of the women delivered preterm. Mean serum urocortin in the preterm delivery group was higher than in the term group, but without statistical significant difference (392.6 +/- 29.23 vs 113.2 +/- 11.0. pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.252). Area under the ROC curve was 0.6, which shows that this test is not appropriate for predicting preterm delivery in women with preterm labor. CONCLUSION: Serum urocortin could not predict women who delivered preterm among women with signs of preterm labor.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether specific proteins in maternal serum and cervical length, alone or in combination, can predict the likelihood that women with intact membranes with threatened preterm labour will deliver spontaneously within 7 days of sampling. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. POPULATION: Women at between 22 and 33 weeks of gestation with threatened preterm labour (n = 142) admitted to the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1995-2005. METHODS: Maternal serum was tested for 27 proteins using multiplex xMAP technology. Individual levels of each protein were compared, and calculations were performed to investigate potential associations between different proteins, cervical length and spontaneous preterm delivery. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find the best cut-off values for continuous variables in relation to spontaneous preterm delivery within 7 days of sampling. Prediction models were created based on a stepwise logistic regression using binary variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Spontaneous preterm delivery within 7 days. RESULTS: In order to determine the best prediction model, we analysed models of serum proteins alone, cervical length alone, and the combination of serum proteins and cervical length. We found one multivariable combined model through the data analysis that more accurately predicted spontaneous preterm delivery within 7 days. This model was based on serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, serum RANTES levels and cervical length (sensitivity 74%, specificity 87%, positive predictive value 76%, negative predictive value 86%, likelihood ratio 5.8 and area under the curve 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of maternal serum proteins and cervical length constituted the best prediction model, and would help determine whether women with threatened preterm labour are likely to deliver within 7 days of measurement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, preterm birth and recurrent miscarriage complicate a significant number of pregnancies. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of angiogenic growth factors is implicated in the pathophysiology of these complications. We aimed to elucidate the role of these angiogenic factors in placentation and to evaluate the predictive value of their protein concentrations and genetic variations in pregnancy complications. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, and retrieved original articles. The search included a combination of terms such as VEGF-A, placental growth factor (PlGF), kinase insert domain receptor, fms-like-tyrosine-kinase receptor 1, soluble fms-like-tyrosine-kinase receptor 1, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, preterm birth, recurrent miscarriage, placenta, prediction and polymorphisms. RESULTS: This review summarizes the current knowledge of the roles of the VEGF family in early placentation and of the abnormalities in maternal plasma and placental expression of angiogenic proteins in adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with normal pregnancy. PlGF and sFLT-1 in combination with other clinical and biochemical markers in late first or second trimester appear to predict early-onset pre-eclampsia with a high sensitivity and specificity. However, VEGF family proteins do not have sufficient power to accurately predict late-onset pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age pregnancies or preterm birth. Functional polymorphisms in these angiogenic genes are implicated in pregnancy complications, but their contribution appears to be minor. CONCLUSIONS: Although the VEGF family has important roles in normal and complicated pregnancy, the current predictive value of the VEGF family as biomarkers appears to be limited to early-onset pre-eclampsia.},

STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study, demographic data were obtained prenatally and birth outcome data were obtained from the medical chart. Cytokines were measured from plasma obtained at 22 to 24 weeks gestation. Data analysis utilized logistic regression. RESULT: PTB was predicted by level of IL-1Ra (odds ratio (OR)=2.55; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.24, 5.24). The interaction between IL-1Ra and IL-6 and between IL-1Ra and IL-10 was significant (Wald=4.01, P=0.04 and Wald=8.84, P<0.003, respectively) and was also predictive of PTB. As IL-1Ra levels increased while IL-10 levels were low, the probability of PTB greatly increased. CONCLUSION: The interactions of select cytokines and cytokine receptor antagonists were associated with PTB. Future research should focus on the changes in cytokines during pregnancy to identify critical periods of change, and examine predictors of the cytokine response.},

For the three outcome variables, the area under curve (AUC) ranged from 0.84 to 0.87 for average clinical attachment level (CAL), 0.78-0.86 for percent of sites with CAL >/= 5 mm, 0.63-0.74 for percent of sites with CAL >/= 6 mm, and 0.71-0.82 for number of missing teeth indicating that they had high discriminating power to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. All other parameters had AUC less than 0.60 and thus had low discriminating power. Average CAL performed the best in predicting the studied adverse pregnancy outcomes because it has the highest AUC. The severity and extent of periodontal disease as measured by CAL can be used to predict the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple score for assessing the risk of early preterm delivery before 32 weeks in women with singleton pregnancies receiving emergency cervical cerclage. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: French tertiary care center from 1994 to 2006. POPULATION: A total of 134 pregnant women underwent emergency cervical cerclage procedure at 15-26 weeks. The analysis concerned 85 singleton pregnancies after exclusion of women with a dilated cervix without visible membranes, or presenting for revision of failed prophylactic cerclage, or who had either preterm premature rupture of membranes or clinical signs of chorioamnionitis. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression methods with rounded coefficients were used to develop a score to predict early preterm delivery before 32 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early preterm delivery before 32 weeks. RESULTS: The score, ranging from 0 to 15 points, was based on the following four criteria independently associated with early preterm delivery: obstetric history; cervical dilatation; membranes bulging into the vagina; and infection. Each score value was associated with a predicted probability of early preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: The score and its associated early preterm probabilities may be a valuable tool to help physicians in advising women about the need for emergency cerclage.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to determine whether there was an association between levels of antenatal maternal serum soluble RAGE (sRAGE), drawn at the time of presentation with preterm labor (PTL), and subsequent preterm birth (PTB). Secondary objectives were to determine whether levels of sRAGE - analyzed from both antenatal maternal serum (MS) and postpartum umbilical cord serum (CS) - were associated with neonatal sepsis. METHODS: Nested case-control analyses were performed within a prospective cohort of patients at risk for PTB. MS was obtained at enrollment and CS at delivery. The sRAGE levels were analyzed. Non-parametric calculations and receiver-operator analyses were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 39.8% of patients delivered < 37 weeks (n=498) and 15% had neonatal sepsis (n=193). In comparing cases and controls, sRAGE was significantly lower in those with than those without an adverse event (PTB: median MS-sRAGE 771.79 versus 948.485 pg/mL, p=0.004; neonatal sepsis: 25-centile CS-sRAGE 1220.49 versus 2244.41 pg/mL, p=0.0013). Adding MS-sRAGE to models of clinical variables significantly enhanced the ability of the model to predict both PTB (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71 versus 0.79, p=0.004) and neonatal sepsis (AUC 0.65 versus 0.75, p=0.04). The negative predictive value of CS-sRAGE for neonatal sepsis was very strong (NPV=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The sRAGE can be used to help predict adverse perinatal outcomes. Patients with higher levels of sRAGE - who therefore may have an enhanced capability to regulate their immune response - appear less likely to experience PTB and neonatal sepsis.},

@article{Lorenz2001,
	abstract = {Significant advances in perinatology and neonatology in the last decade have resulted in increased survival of extremely premature infants. Survival rates for infants born in tertiary perinatal and neonatal care centers in the United States in the 1990s increase with each week of gestational age from 22 through 26 weeks. Reported survival rates at 22 weeks range from 0% to 21% in the few reporting studies. Reported survival rates at 23 and 24 weeks range from 5% to 46% and from 40% to 59%, respectively. These may not be the maximum survival rates possible because at these gestational ages information is either insufficient to determine that obstetric and neonatal intensive care strategies to maximize neonatal survival were used or it is specified that such strategies were not used. Reported survival rates at 25 and 26 weeks range from 60% to 82% and from from 75% to 93%, respectively. The literature regarding the prevalence of major neurodevelopmental disabilities among extremely premature survivors in the last 25 years is heteogeneous, and the reported prevalances of major disability vary much more than do survival rates. However, the majority of extremely premature infants who survive will be free of major disability. Overall, approximately one fifth to one quarter of survivors have at least one major disability-impaired mental development, cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness. Impaired mental development is the most prevalent disability (17%-21% [95% CI] of survivors affected), followed by cerebral palsy (12%-15% of survivors affected). Blindness and deafness are less common (5% to 8% and 3% to 5% of survivors affected, respectively). Approximately one half of disabled survivors have more than one major disability. Based on studies of infants less than 750 to 1,000 grams birth weight, it can be anticipated that approximately another half of all extremely premature survivors will have one or more subtle neurodevelopmental disabilities in the school and teenage years. There is little evidence to suggest that long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has changed from the late 1970s to the early 1990s or with increasing survival. Survival of individual extremely premature infants cannot be accurately predicted in the immediate perinatal period. Major disability cannot be accurately predicted for individual survivors during the course in the newborn intensive care unit.},

	abstract = {Distinct problems in the analysis of failure times with competing causes of failure include the estimation of treatment or exposure effects on specific failure types, the study of interrelations among failure types, and the estimation of failure rates for some causes given the removal of certain other failure types. The usual formation of these problems is in terms of conceptual or latent failure times for each failure type. This approach is criticized on the basis of unwarranted assumptions, lack of physical interpretation and identifiability problems. An alternative approach utilizing cause-specific hazard functions for observable quantities, including time-dependent covariates, is proposed. Cause-specific hazard functions are shown to be the basic estimable quantities in the competing risks framework. A method, involving the estimation of parameters that relate time-dependent risk indicators for some causes to cause-specific hazard functions for other causes, is proposed for the study of interrelations among failure types. Further, it is argued that the problem of estimation of failure rates under the removal of certain causes is not well posed until a mechanism for cause removal is specified. Following such a specification, one will sometimes be in a position to make sensible extrapolations from available data to situations involving cause removal. A clinical program in bone marrow transplantation for leukemia provides a setting for discussion and illustration of each of these ideas. Failure due to censoring in a survivorship study leads to further discussion.},

	abstract = {With explanatory covariates, the standard analysis for competing risks data involves modeling the cause-specific hazard functions via a proportional hazards assumption. Unfortunately, the cause-specific hazard function does not have a direct interpretation in terms of survival probabilities for the particular failure type. In recent years many clinicians have begun using the cumulative incidence function, the marginal failure probabilities for a particular cause, which is intuitively appealing and more easily explained to the nonstatistician. The cumulative incidence is especially relevant in cost-effectiveness analyses in which the survival probabilities are needed to determine treatment utility. Previously, authors have considered methods for combining estimates of the cause-specific hazard functions under the proportional hazards formulation. However, these methods do not allow the analyst to directly assess the effect of a covariate on the marginal probability function. In this article we propose a novel semiparametric proportional hazards model for the subdistribution. Using the partial likelihood principle and weighting techniques, we derive estimation and inference procedures for the finite-dimensional regression parameter under a variety of censoring scenarios. We give a uniformly consistent estimator for the predicted cumulative incidence for an individual with certain covariates; confidence intervals and bands can be obtained analytically or with an easy-to-implement simulation technique. To contrast the two approaches, we analyze a dataset from a breast cancer clinical trial under both models.},

This heterogeneity must be accounted for in the interpretation, as it can imply otherwise unexpected results. This is illustrated by diabetic nephropathy, a serious complication experienced by some diabetic patients. A mathematical model with varying susceptibility can explain that the incidence increases until 20 years duration of diabetes and later decreases. The hospital-based data cover patients diagnosed during 1933-1972. They are interval censored, because early detection of nephropathy requires chemical analysis of urine samples. The data are consistent with a model where less than half of the patients are susceptible, and for each of these the hazard is increasing. The estimated degree of heterogeneity markedly depends on the assumed model. The dependence on age at onset and calendar time of onset is examined. The highest risk is seen at onset age 13-17 years, and the risk decreases with calendar time. The effect of covariates on the hazard is markedly different for the various models, but this is partly a matter of parametrization, as the disagreement is reduced by a reparametrization inspired by accelerated failure time models.},

@article{Richiardi2013,
	abstract = { In epidemiological studies it is often necessary to disentangle the pathways that link an exposure to an outcome. Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},

@article{Kawachi2010,
	abstract = {An association between higher educational attainment and better health status has been repeatedly reported in the literature. Similarly, thousands of studies have found a relationship between higher income and better health. However, whether these repeated observations amount to causality remains a challenge, not least because of the practical limitations of randomizing people to receive different amounts of money or schooling. In this essay, we review the potential causal mechanisms linking schooling and income to health, and discuss the twin challenges to causal inference in observational studies, in other words, reverse causation and omitted variable bias. We provide a survey of the empirical attempts to identify the causal effects of schooling and income on health, including natural experiments. There is evidence to suggest that schooling is causally related to improvements in health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that raising the incomes of the poor leads to improvement in their health outcomes. Much remains unknown beyond these crude findings, however; for example, what type of education matters for health, or whether there is a difference between the health impacts of temporary income shocks versus changes in long-term income.},

A central question is the degree to which these associations reflect a causal association. If so, redistribution of income would improve health. This paper discusses two ways in which income could be causally related to health: through a direct effect on the material conditions necessary for biological survival, and through an effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances. The fewer goods and services are provided publicly by the community, the more important individual income is for health. Under present U.S. circumstances, a policy of counteracting growing income inequalities through the tax and benefit system and of public provision appears justified.},

	abstract = {Study objective: Many previous studies on socioeconomic inequalities in health have neglected the causal interdependencies between different socioeconomic indicators. This study examines the pathways between three socioeconomic determinants of ill health.Design, setting, and participants: Cross sectional survey data from the Helsinki health study in 2000 and 2001 were used. Each year employees of the City of Helsinki, reaching 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 years received a mailed questionnaire. Altogether 6243 employees responded (80% women, response rate 68%). Socioeconomic indicators were education, occupational class, and household income. Health indicators were limiting longstanding illness and self rated health. Inequality indices were calculated based on logistic regression analysis.Main results: Each socioeconomic indicator showed a clear gradient with health. Among women half of inequalities in limiting longstanding illness by education were mediated through occupational class and household income. Inequalities by occupational class were largely explained by education. A small part of inequalities for income were explained by education and occupational class. For self rated health the pathways were broadly similar. Among men most of the inequalities in limiting longstanding illness by education were mediated through occupational class and income. Part of occupational class inequalities were explained by education. Two thirds of inequalities by income were explained by education and occupational class.Conclusions: Parts of the effects of each socioeconomic indicator on health are either explained by or mediated through other socioeconomic indicators. Analyses of the predictive power of socioeconomic indicators on health run the risk of being fruitless, if interrelations between various indicators are neglected.},

@article{McMichael1999,
	abstract = {``Modern epidemiology'' has a primary orientation to the study of multiple risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases. If epidemiologists are to understand the determinants of population health in terms that extend beyond proximate, individual-level risk factors (and their biological mediators), they must learn to apply a social-ecologic systems perspective. The mind-set and methods of modern epidemiology entail the following four main constraints that limit engagement in issues of wider context: 1) a preoccupation with proximate risk factors; 2) a focus on individual-level versus population-level influences on health; 3) a typically modular (time-windowed) view of how individuals undergo changes in risk status (i.e., a life-stage vs. a life-course model of risk acquisition); and 4) the, as yet, unfamiliar challenge of scenario-based forecasting of health consequences of future, large-scale social and environmental changes. The evolution of the content and methods of epidemiology continues. Epidemiologists are gaining insights into the complex social and environmental systems that are the context for health and disease; thinking about population health in increasingly ecologic terms; developing dynamic, interactive, life-course models of disease risk acquisition; and extending their spatial-temporal frame of reference as they perceive the health risks posed by escalating human pressures on the wider environment. The constraints of ``the proximate'' upon epidemiology are thus loosening as the end of the century approaches. Am J Epidemiol 1999; 149: 887--97.},

Though observational studies and RCTs often provide comparable estimates, the questioning of observational analyses has recently intensified because of randomized-observational discrepancies regarding the effect of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on coronary heart disease. Reanalyses of observational data that excluded prevalent users of hormone replacement therapy led to attenuated discrepancies, which begs the question of whether exclusion of prevalent users should be generally recommended. In the current study, the authors evaluated the effect of excluding prevalent users of statins in a meta-analysis of observational studies of persons with cardiovascular disease. The pooled, multivariate-adjusted mortality hazard ratio for statin use was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 0.91) in 4 studies that compared incident users with nonusers, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) in 13 studies that compared a combination of prevalent and incident users with nonusers, and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.66) in 13 studies that compared prevalent users with nonusers. The corresponding hazard ratio from 18 RCTs was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.91). It appears that the greater the proportion of prevalent statin users in observational studies, the larger the discrepancy between observational and randomized estimates.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We seek to expand on a biopsychosocial framework underlying the etiology of excess preterm birth experienced by African-American women by exploring short inter-pregnancy intervals as a partial explanatory factor. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative analyses of published studies that met specified criteria for assessing the association of inter-pregnancy interval and preterm birth. METHODS: We determine whether inter-pregnancy interval is associated with preterm birth, what the underlying causal mechanism may be, whether African-American women are more likely than Caucasian women to have short intervals, and whether achieving an optimal interval will result in reduced African-American-Caucasian gap in preterm births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and adjusted odds ratios for preterm birth, with the referent group being the interval closest to the 'ideal' of 18-23 months and the exposed group having intervals <12 months or some subset of that inter-pregnancy interval. Results. Inter-pregnancy interval less than six months increases preterm birth by about 40%. The mechanism may be through failure to replenish maternal nutritional stores. While there may not be an interaction between race and short inter-pregnancy interval, short intervals can explain about 4% of the African-American-Caucasian gap in preterm birth because African-American women are approximately 1.8 times as likely to have inter-pregnancy intervals of less than six months. Limited studies indicate that optimal intervals can be achieved through appropriate counseling and health care. CONCLUSIONS: Excess risk for preterm birth may be reduced by up to 8% among African-Americans and up to 4% among Caucasians through increasing inter-pregnancy intervals to the optimal length of 18-23 months.},

	abstract = {One approach to quantifying the magnitude of confounding in observational studies is to compare estimates with and without adjustment for a covariate, but this strategy is known to be defective for noncollapsible measures such as the odds ratio. Comparing estimates from marginal structural and standard logistic regression models, the total difference between crude and conditional effects can be decomposed into the sum of a noncollapsibility effect and confounding bias. We provide an analytic approach to assess the noncollapsibility effect in a point-exposure study and provide a general formula for expressing the noncollapsibility effect. Next, we provide a graphical approach that illustrates the relationship between the noncollapsibility effect and the baseline risk, and reveals the behavior of the noncollapsibility effect for a range of different exposure and covariate effects. Various observations about noncollapsibility can be made from the different scenarios with or without confounding; for example, the magnitude of effect of the covariate plays a more important role in the noncollapsibility effect than does that of the effect of the exposure. In order to explore the noncollapsibility effect of the odds ratio in the presence of time-varying confounding, we simulated an observational cohort study. The magnitude of noncollapsibility was generally comparable to the effect in the point-exposure study in our simulation settings. Finally, in an applied example we demonstrate that collapsibility can have an important impact on estimation in practice.},

	abstract = {Approaches for analyzing the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes have been the source of much debate and many publications. Much of the problem, in our view, is the conflation of time at risk with gestational age at birth (or birth weight, a proxy for gestational age). We consider the causal questions underlying such analyses with the help of a generic directed acyclic graph. We discuss competing risks and populations at risk in the context of appropriate numerators and denominators, respectively. We summarize 3 different approaches to quantifying risks with respect to gestational age, each of which addresses a distinct etiological or prognostic question (i.e., cumulative risk, prospective risk, or instantaneous risk (hazard)) and suggest the appropriate denominators for each. We show how the gestational age-specific risk of perinatal death (PND) can be decomposed as the product of the gestational age-specific risk of birth and the risk of PND conditional on birth at a given gestational age. Finally, we demonstrate how failure to consider the first of these 2 risks leads to selection bias. This selection bias creates the well-known crossover paradox, thus obviating the need to posit common causes of early birth and PND other than the study exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous estimates of the effect of occupational asbestos on lung cancer mortality have been obtained by using methods that are subject to the healthy-worker survivor bias. G-estimation of a structural nested model provides consistent exposure effect estimates under this bias. METHODS: We estimated the effect of cumulative asbestos exposure on lung cancer mortality in a cohort comprising 2564 textile factory workers who were followed from January 1940 to December 2001. RESULTS: At entry, median age was 23 years, with 42% of the cohort being women and 20% nonwhite. During the follow-up period, 15% of person-years were classified as occurring while employed and 13% as occupationally exposed to asbestos. For a 100 fiber-year/ml increase in cumulative asbestos, a Weibull model adjusting for sex, race, birth year, baseline exposure, and age at study entry yielded a survival time ratio of 0.88 (95% confidence interval = 0.83 to 0.93). Further adjustment for work status yielded no practical change. The corresponding survival time ratio obtained using g-estimation of a structural nested model was 0.57 (0.33 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for the healthy-worker survivor bias resulted in a 35% stronger effect estimate. However, this estimate was considerably less precise. When healthy-worker survivor bias is suspected, methods that account for it should be used.},

@article{Platt2004,
	abstract = {	Birth-weight- and gestational-age-specific perinatal mortality curves intersect when compared by race and maternal smoking. The authors propose a new measure to replace fetal and infant mortality and an analytic strategy to assess the effects of risk factors on this outcome. They used 1998 data for US Blacks and Whites. Age-specific post--last menstrual period (LMP) mortality rate was defined as the proportion of deaths (stillbirth, perinatal death, or infant death) at a given age post-LMP. The authors used extended Cox regression with time-varying covariates and hazard ratios to model the effects of race and smoking on post-LMP mortality. Perinatal mortality rates (conventional calculation) for Blacks and Whites showed the expected crossover. However, analyses of post-LMP mortality showed no crossover. For the Black-White comparison, a hazard ratio of 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.67, 1.77) was obtained. The hazard was higher for smokers than for nonsmokers, but the hazard ratio increased from 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.22) at 22 weeks to 1.82 (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 1.92) at 40 weeks. The hazard ratio associated with birth was also time dependent: higher than 1 for preterm gestation and lower than 1 for term gestation. The increasing adverse effect of smoking with gestational age suggests an accumulating effect of smoking on mortality. Modeling post-LMP mortality eliminates the crossover paradox for race and maternal smoking in a single statistical model.},

The authors screened 8,312 United Kingdom men and women 3 times over 10 years between 1991 and 2004 for waist circumference, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6; identified participants with the metabolic syndrome; and measured childhood health retrospectively. Health-related selection was examined in 2 ways: 1) childhood health problems as predictors of adult occupational position and 2) adult cardiometabolic factors as predictors of subsequent promotion at work. Social causation was assessed using adult occupational position as a predictor of subsequent change in cardiometabolic factors. Hospitalization during childhood and lower birth weight were associated with lower occupational position (both P's </= 0.002). Cardiometabolic factors in adulthood did not consistently predict promotion. In contrast, lower adult occupational position predicted adverse changes in several cardiometabolic factors (waist circumference, body mass index, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin) and an increased risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome (all P's </= 0.008). These findings suggest that health-related selection operates at younger ages and that social causation contributes to socioeconomic differences in cardiometabolic health in midlife.},

	abstract = {Objective: To explore with UK and international policy advisors how research evidence influences public health policy making, and how its relevance and utility could be improved, with specific reference to the evidence on the production and reduction of health inequalities.Design, setting, and participants: Qualitative residential workshop involving senior policy advisors with a substantive role in policy development across a range of sectors (mainly public health, but also including education, social welfare, and health services). In four in depth sessions, facilitated by the authors, focused questions were presented to participants. Their responses were then analysed thematically to identify key themes, relating to the availability and utility of existing evidence on health inequalities.Main results: The lack of an equity dimension in much aetiological and evaluative research was highlighted by participants. Much public health research was also felt to have weak underlying theoretical underpinnings. As well as evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policy and other interventions, they identified a need for predictive research, and for methodological research to further develop methods for assessing the impact on health of clusters of interventions.Conclusions: This study reinforces the view that there is a lack of information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies, and it uncovered additional gaps in the health inequalities evidence base. A companion paper discusses researchers' views of how the production of more relevant public health evidence can be stimulated.},

	abstract = {A general method is proposed for estimating the potential impact of a prevention program involving risk factor modification on the incidence of specific diseases in a target population. An evaluative framework for comparing alternative intervention strategies is also presented. On the basis of results from epidemiologic studies, the user must specify certain parameters regarding the distribution of the risk factor that is to be modified in the population, the magnitude of the association between the risk factor and disease, and the total risk of disease in the population. A quantitative measure, called the potential impact fraction, is derived to estimate the proportion of expected new cases that may be prevented under intervention programs of varying success. Estimates of this measure are then used to assess the potential efficacy, effectiveness, adequacy, and efficiency of planned intervention strategies. The method is illustrated with published data relating relative weight and coronary heart disease among middle-aged U.S. men, comparing different strategies of weight reduction. Key assumptions of the method and interpretation of results are discussed.},

@article{Dubois2003,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the source and the scope of social inequalities in infant feeding practices. It examines the extent to which different recommendations are followed in different social groups and highlights the main factors influencing the total adherence to three recommendations at the population level. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The study follows a representative sample (n=2103) of the children born in 1998 in the province of Quebec (Canada). Detailed information on breast-feeding and complementary feeding was collected at 5 and 17 months by face-to-face interviews with the mother. The independent variables were mother's age, mother's education level, poverty level, family type, socio-economic status (SES) and living area. Odds ratios (adjusted for baby's rank in the family, birth weight and premature birth) are presented for breast-feeding, and for formula and cows' milk consumption, at different ages. The adherence to a combined indicator cumulating three recommendations (breast-fed at birth, complementary food at 4 months or later and cows' milk at 9 months or later) is also presented. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that adherence to the recommendations is low in Quebec. Breast-feeding initiation, duration and its exclusivity improved with mother's age and education level and SES. Adherence to the different recommendations was interrelated, indicating an accumulation of bad nutritional circumstances for children in low-SES families. The odds of being fed in accordance with the three studied recommendations, when living in a family with the highest SES, was 2.3 times higher than when living in a family with the lowest SES. When living with a highly educated mother, the odds ratio was 2.7 times higher than when living with a low-educated mother. For mother's age, the odds ratio reached 3.7 for children from mothers aged > or =35 years, in comparison with children from mothers < or =24 years old. When SES or mother's education level was combined with mother's age, the children in the best situation were >8 more times likely than the least privileged children to be fed in accordance with these recommendations. Living area was not related with infant feeding during the first year of life. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-feeding and nutrition could be related with different health and cognitive outcomes in childhood and later in life. Consequently, social disparities in diet during infancy could play a role in the development of social and health inequalities more broadly observed at the population level. Intervention to improve adherence to breast-feeding and nutrition recommendations in infancy should be prioritised and evaluated for its impact on the reduction on infant diet inequalities over time.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether breast-feeding has a dose-related protective effect against illness and whether it confers special health benefits to poor infants. METHODS: The association between breast-feeding dose and illnesses in the first 6 months of life was analyzed with generalized estimating equations regression for 7092 infants from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Breast-feeding dose (ratio of breast-feedings to other feedings) was categorized as full, most, equal, less, or no breast-feeding. RESULTS: Compared with no breast-feeding, full breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea, cough or wheeze, and vomiting and lower mean ratios of illness months and sick baby medical visits. Most breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea and cough or wheeze, and equal breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of cough or wheeze. Full, most, and equal breast-feeding infants without siblings had lower odds ratios of ear infections and certain other illnesses, but those with siblings did not. Less breast-feeding infants had no reduced odds ratios of illness. Findings did not vary by income. CONCLUSIONS: Full breast-feeding was associated with the lowest illness rates. Minimal (less) breast-feeding was not protective. Breast-feeding conferred similar health benefits in all economic groups.},

Such models are related to and compared with other analytic approaches often used in epidemiology, including regression analysis, causal diagrams, causal mediation analysis, and marginal structural models. Several of these other approaches in fact developed out of the SEM literature. However, SEMs themselves tend to make much stronger assumptions than these other techniques. SEMs estimate more types of effects than do these other techniques, but this comes at the price of additional assumptions. Many of these assumptions have often been ignored and not carefully evaluated when SEMs have been used in practice. In light of the strong assumptions employed by SEMs, the author argues that they should be used principally for the purposes of exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation when a broad range of effects are potentially of interest.},

@article{Flacking2007,
	abstract = {Background: The propensity to breastfeed is not only of importance with regard to the beneficial effects on the individual, but is also of concern as an indicator of health behaviour related to social conditions. Thus, our aim was to investigate the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on breastfeeding duration in mothers of preterm and term infants. Methods: Prospective population based cohort study. Data for infants registered in breastfeeding databases of two Swedish counties 1993--2001 were matched with data from two national registries---the Medical Birth Registry and Statistics Sweden. A total of 37 343 mothers of 2093 preterm and 35 250 term infants participated. Results: All socioeconomic factors; maternal educational level, maternal unemployment benefit, social welfare and equivalent disposable income, were strongly associated with breastfeeding when examined individually in mothers of preterm and term infants. Some of the associations attenuated when investigated simultaneously. Independently of SES and confounders, mothers of preterm infants were at higher risk of weaning before the infant was 2 months (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.70; 95% confidence interval ((CI) 1.46--1.99)), 4 months (OR 1.79; CI 1.60--2.01), 6 months (OR 1.48; CI 1.33--1.64), and 9 months old (OR 1.19; CI 1.06--1.34), compared with mothers of term infants. Conclusions: In Sweden, despite its social welfare support system and a positive breastfeeding tradition, SES clearly has an impact on the breastfeeding duration. Mothers of preterm infants breastfeed for a shorter time compared with mothers of term infants, even when adjustments are made for SES and confounders.},

@article{Woo2008,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies suggest that breastfeeding is protective for later obesity; however, this association has not held among all racial and socioeconomic status groups. Racial and socioeconomic status differences in breastfeeding behavior have also been noted. In this study, we formally test whether breastfeeding mediates the relationship between race and socioeconomic status with adolescent adiposity. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 739 black and white 10- to 19-year-old adolescents who participated in a large, school-based study. Parents provided information on parental education, used to measure socioeconomic status, and whether the child was breastfed as an infant. BMI was used to measure adolescent adiposity and was analyzed as a continuous measure (BMI z score) using linear regression and categorically (BMI > or = 85th and > or = 95th percentile) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Black adolescents and those without a college-educated parent were less likely to have been breastfed for > 4 months. Race and parental education were each independent predictors of BMI z score and of having BMI > or = 85th percentile or BMI > or = 95th percentile. When added to the model, being breastfed for > 4 months was also independently associated with lower BMI z score and lower odds of having BMI > or = 85th percentile or BMI > or = 95th percentile. Inclusion of being breastfed for > 4 months resulted in a 25% decrease in racial and parental education differences in adolescent BMI z score, supporting partial mediation. CONCLUSIONS; Having been breastfed for > 4 months was associated with lower adolescent BMI z score and lower odds of having a BMI > or = 85th percentile or BMI > or = 95th percentile, independent of race or parental education. Furthermore, these analyses suggest that being breastfed for > 4 months partially explains the relationship between social disadvantage and increased adiposity. Increasing breastfeeding duration could result in lower adolescent adiposity for all racial and socioeconomic status groups and potentially minimize socioeconomic disparities in adiposity.},

@article{Heck2006,
	abstract = {Objectives. To examine multiple dimensions of socioeconomic status and breastfeeding among a large, random sample of ethnically diverse women. METHODS: This study used logistic regression analysis to examine the influence of a range of socioeconomic factors on the chances of ever breastfeeding among a stratified random sample of 10,519 women delivering live births in California for 1999 through 2001. Measures of socioeconomic status included family income as a percentage of the federal poverty level, maternal education, paternal education, maternal occupation, and paternal occupation. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, there was a marked socioeconomic gradient in breastfeeding. Women with higher family incomes, those who had or whose partners had higher education levels, and women who had or whose partners had professional or executive occupations were more likely than their counterparts to breastfeed. After adjustment for many potential confounders, maternal and paternal education remained positively associated with breastfeeding, while income and occupation were no longer significant. Compared with other racial or ethnic groups, foreign-born Latina women were the most likely to breastfeed. CONCLUSIONS: The significant association of maternal and paternal education with breastfeeding, even after adjustment for income, occupation, and many other factors, suggests that social policies affecting educational attainment may be important factors in breastfeeding. Breastfeeding rates may be influenced by health education specifically or by more general levels of schooling among mothers and their partners. The continuing importance of racial/ethnic differences after adjustment for socioeconomic factors could reflect unmeasured socioeconomic effects, cultural differences, and/or policies in Latin American countries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of breastfeeding on hospitalization for diarrheal and lower respiratory tract infections in the first 8 months after birth in contemporary United Kingdom.METHODS. The study was a population-based survey (sweep 1 of the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study). Data on infant feeding, infant health, and a range of confounding factors were available for 15890 healthy, singleton, term infants who were born in 2000--2002. The main outcome measures were parental report of hospitalization for diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection in the first 8 months after birth.RESULTS. Seventy percent of infants were breastfed (ever), 34% received breast milk for at least 4 months, and 1.2% were exclusively breastfed for at least 6 months. By 8 months of age, 12% of infants had been hospitalized (1.1% for diarrhea and 3.2% for lower respiratory tract infection). Data analyzed by month of age, with adjustment for confounders, show that exclusive breastfeeding, compared with not breastfeeding, protects against hospitalization for diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection. The effect of partial breastfeeding is weaker. Population-attributable fractions suggest that an estimated 53% of diarrhea hospitalizations could have been prevented each month by exclusive breastfeeding and 31% by partial breastfeeding. Similarly, 27% of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations could have been prevented each month by exclusive breastfeeding and 25% by partial breastfeeding. The protective effect of breastfeeding for these outcomes wears off soon after breastfeeding cessation.CONCLUSIONS. Breastfeeding, particularly when exclusive and prolonged, protects against severe morbidity in contemporary United Kingdom. A population-level increase in exclusive, prolonged breastfeeding would be of considerable potential benefit for public health.},

In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities. We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources.

However, most of this research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.},

	abstract = {The Ontario Mother and Infant Survey examined health and social service utilization of postpartum women and newborn infants from five hospital sites. A cross-sectional multilanguage survey design with longitudinal follow-up was used: 1,250 eligible, consenting women completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital and 875 women participated in a structured telephone interview at four weeks post-discharge. Rates of newborn infant readmission ranged from 2.4% to 6.7%. The best predictors of readmission were: main source of household income was other than employment; maternal self-rating of health was poor; mother anticipated inadequate help and support at home following discharge; mother received help from friends/neighbours following discharge; and mother had concern about infant care and behaviour. Readmission was not associated with length of postpartum hospital stay. The study findings suggest that there is a complex relationship between infant health care needs, family resources and provider practices that produces clinically important, site-specific readmission patterns.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To study the frequency and associations of early postpartum discharge and infant readmission to hospital. METHODS: Infants readmitted to hospital during the first 28 days of life in 1998 in the Northern Region of the UK were studied. RESULTS: A total of 4743 of 11,338 (42%) babies were discharged on or before the first postnatal day. Rates of early discharge varied significantly between hospitals. Infants <2500 g at birth (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.66), infants 35-37 weeks gestation at birth (AOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.86), and firstborn infants (AOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.10) were less likely to be discharged early. Women from more deprived areas were more likely to be discharged early (AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.67). A total of 907 of 32,015 (2.8%) babies liveborn in the region were readmitted to hospital during 1998. Readmission rates varied significantly by hospital of birth but not by timing of discharge. Babies <2500 g at birth (AOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.28) and babies born at 35-37 weeks gestation (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.57) were more likely to be readmitted. Breast fed babies were less likely to be readmitted (AOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90). Infants initially discharged early were not more likely to be readmitted. CONCLUSIONS: Early discharge occurred variably in the Northern Region in 1998. It is not associated with readmission to hospital. Breast feeding is associated with lower rates of readmission to hospital.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the proportion, geographic variation, and predictors of infant hospital readmission within 6 weeks of the postbirth discharge. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted of all infants who were born from 1997 through 2001, linkable to the birth mother, and discharged alive from the hospital (N = 68 681) using hospital discharge files in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The following predictors of readmission were examined using logistic regression: preterm, low birth weight, neighborhood income, geographic location (the North, Rural South, and Urban areas of Winnipeg and Brandon), breastfeeding status, length of stay, maternal age, and type of delivery. Using 9 non-Winnipeg regions and 12 Winnipeg subregions, ecologic correlations (1-tailed Spearman) between newborn hospital readmission rates and the following were examined: 1) a region's overall health status, measured by the premature mortality rate (PMR), or death before aged 75 years and 2) a region's socioeconomic risk, using the Socio-Economic Factor Index (SEFI). RESULTS: The proportion of infants who were readmitted to the hospital at least once within 6 weeks of postbirth hospital discharge was 3.95%, with respiratory illness the leading cause (22.3% of readmissions). Risk of readmission was higher for infants who were born preterm (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-2.10), who were of the 3 lowest income quintiles (lowest: AOR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.77-2.32; low: AOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.29-1.71; middle: AOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08-1.47), who resided in the North (AOR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.66-2.07) or Rural South (AOR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.14-1.36), who were not breastfed (AOR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.20-1.44), whose mother's age was 17 or younger (AOR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10-1.55), whose mother was 18 to 19 years of age (AOR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09-144), or who were born by cesarean section (AOR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.19-1.43). Regional readmission rates were correlated with PMR (9 non-Winnipeg regions: r = 0.77 for PMR and r = 0.68 for SEFI; 12 Winnipeg Community Areas: r = 0.49 for PMR and r = 0.73 for SEFI). CONCLUSIONS: Income and geography are strongly associated with newborn hospital readmission. Modifiable risk factors include increasing breastfeeding rates, decreasing cesarean section rates, and decreasing adolescent pregnancy rates (or increasing adolescent parental support), but these need additional study to establish causation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the maternal and infant risk factors associated with hospital admission in the first year and estimate the associated costs of infant hospitalization. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the Perinatal Data Collection for 599753 liveborn infants born in New South Wales, Australia, 2001-2007 were linked to hospital admission data. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between maternal and infant characteristics and admission to hospital once, and more than once in the first year; and average costs for total hospital admissions were calculated. RESULTS: Almost 15% of infants were admitted to hospital once and 4.6% had multiple admissions. Gestational age <37 weeks was most strongly associated with admission to hospital once, and severe neonatal morbidity was most strongly associated with multiple admissions (aOR 2.60; 95% CI 2.47-2.75). Infants born <39 weeks gestational age, to adolescent mothers, mothers who smoke, are not married, or had a planned delivery also have an increased risk of multiple admissions. Infants with severe neonatal morbidity contributed 27% of total infant hospital costs. With each increasing week of gestational age the mean annual cost decreased on average 10% and 27% for infants with and without neonatal morbidity respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Infants born with severe neonatal morbidity have increased hospitalizations in the first year; however, the majority of burden on health system is by infants without severe neonatal morbidity. Hospitalizations, and associated costs, increased with decreasing gestational age, even for infants born at 37-38 weeks. Targeted public health strategies may reduce the burden of infant hospitalizations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking is associated with infant respiratory infections and with increased risk of low birth weight infants and preterm birth. This study assesses the association of maternal smoking during pregnancy with both respiratory and nonrespiratory infectious disease (ID) morbidity and mortality in infants. METHODS: We conducted 2 retrospective case-control analyses of infants born in Washington State from 1987 to 2004 using linked birth certificate, death certificate and hospital discharge records. One assessed morbidity--infants hospitalized due to IDs within 1 year of birth (47,404 cases/48,233 controls). The second assessed mortality--infants who died within 1 year due to IDs (627 cases/2730 controls). RESULTS: Maternal smoking was associated with both hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46, 1.58) and mortality (AOR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.96) due to any ID. In subgroup analyses, maternal smoking was associated with hospitalization due to a broad range of IDs including both respiratory (AOR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.63, 1.76) and nonrespiratory IDs (AOR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.34). Further stratification by birth weight and gestational age did not appreciably change these estimates. In contrast, there was no association of maternal smoking with ID infant mortality when only low birth weight infants were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking was associated with a broad range of both respiratory and nonrespiratory ID outcomes. Despite attenuation of the mortality association among low birth weight infants, ID hospitalization was found to be independent of both birth weight and gestational age. These findings suggest that full-term infants of normal weight whose mothers smoked may suffer an increased risk of serious ID morbidity and mortality.},

Although improved during the last four decades, the U.S. IMR remains within the lowest tier of IMRs for all industrialized countries, and black American infants remain disproportionately represented in low birthweight (LBW) and infant death statistics. Numerous risk factors have been analyzed for their relative contributions to the U.S. IMR and black-white infant survival health disparities. Those factors include prenatal care quality and access, maternal socioeconomic status (SES), HIV/AIDS status, infections, intrapartum risk factors, existing comorbidities, social support, and nutritional status. However, the role of these and other factors have not fully explained the higher infant mortality risks for black infants. This review will discuss a variety of risk factors that contribute to infant mortality disparities between non-Hispanic black and white infants. Among those factors, the goal will be to review selected topics pertaining to maternal SES, LBW, preterm birth, perinatology advances, birth record data quality, maternal stress, prenatal care adequacy, and physical and substance abuse, and the relationships of those topics to black-white IMR health disparities.},

	abstract = {Living in poverty places children at very high risk for problems across a variety of domains, including schooling, behavioral regulation, and health. Aspects of cognitive functioning, such as information processing, may underlie these kinds of problems. How might poverty affect the brain functions underlying these cognitive processes? Here, we address this question by observing and analyzing repeated measures of brain development of young children between five months and four years of age from economically diverse backgrounds (n = 77). In doing so, we have the opportunity to observe changes in brain growth as children begin to experience the effects of poverty. These children underwent MRI scanning, with subjects completing between 1 and 7 scans longitudinally. Two hundred and three MRI scans were divided into different tissue types using a novel image processing algorithm specifically designed to analyze brain data from young infants. Total gray, white, and cerebral (summation of total gray and white matter) volumes were examined along with volumes of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Infants from low-income families had lower volumes of gray matter, tissue critical for processing of information and execution of actions. These differences were found for both the frontal and parietal lobes. No differences were detected in white matter, temporal lobe volumes, or occipital lobe volumes. In addition, differences in brain growth were found to vary with socioeconomic status (SES), with children from lower-income households having slower trajectories of growth during infancy and early childhood. Volumetric differences were associated with the emergence of disruptive behavioral problems.},

These effects may be pronounced in low SES and ethnic minority families. We explored prenatal partner support as a buffer of the impact of prenatal stress on cortisol reactivity of infants born to low-income Mexican American women. Women (N=220; age 18-42; 84% Spanish-speaking; 89% foreign born; modal family income $10,000-$15,000) reported on economic stress and satisfaction with spousal/partner support during the prenatal period (26-38 weeks gestation), and infant salivary cortisol reactivity to mildly challenging mother-infant interaction tasks was assessed at women's homes at six weeks postpartum. Multilevel models estimated the interactive effect of prenatal stress and partner support on cortisol reactivity, controlling for covariates and potential confounds. Infants born to mothers who reported high prenatal stress and low partner support exhibited higher cortisol reactivity relative to those whose mothers reported high support or low stress. The effects did not appear to operate through birth outcomes. For low-income Mexican American women, partner support may buffer the impact of prenatal stress on infant cortisol reactivity, potentially promoting more adaptive infant health and development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess separate and joint effects of low socioeconomic status (SES) and moderate prematurity on preschool developmental delay. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with a community-based sample of preterm- and term-born children (Longitudinal Preterm Outcome Project). We assessed SES on the basis of education, occupation, and family income. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire was used to assess developmental delay at age 4 years. We determined scores for overall development, and domains fine motor, gross motor, communication, problem-solving, and personal-social of 926 moderately preterm-born (MP) (32-36 weeks gestation) and 544 term-born children. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, we used standardized values for SES and gestational age (GA). RESULTS: Prevalence rates for overall developmental delay were 12.5%, 7.8%, and 5.6% in MP children with low, intermediate, and high SES, respectively, and 7.2%, 4.0%, and 2.8% in term-born children, respectively. The risk for overall developmental delay increased more with decreasing SES than with decreasing GA, but the difference was not statistically significant: OR (95% CI) for a 1 standard deviation decrease were: 1.62 (1.30-2.03) and 1.34 (1.05-1.69), respectively, after adjustment for sex, number of siblings, and maternal age. No interaction was found except for communication, showing that effects of SES and GA are mostly multiplicative. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES and moderate prematurity are separate risk factors with multiplicative effects on developmental delay. The double jeopardy of MP children with low SES needs special attention in pediatric care.},

@article{Blackburn2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aetiology of disabling chronic conditions in childhood in high income countries is not fully understood, particularly the association with socio-economic status (SES). Very few studies have used longitudinal datasets to examine whether exposure to social disadvantage in early childhood increases the risk of developing chronic conditions in later childhood. Here we examine this association, and its temporal ordering, with onset of all-cause disabling chronic later childhood in children reported as free from disability in early childhood. METHODS: The study comprised a prospective cohort study, using data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONSLS) for England and Wales. The study sample included 52,839 children with complete data born between 1981-1991 with no disabling chronic condition/s in 1991. Index cases were children with disability recorded in 2001. Comparison cases were children with no recorded disability in 1991. A socio-economic disadvantage index (SDI) was constructed from data on social class, housing tenure and car/van access. Associations were explored with logistic regression modelling controlling sequentially for potentially confounding factors; age, gender, ethnicity and lone parenthood. RESULTS: By 2001, 2049 (4%) had at least one disability. Socio-economic disadvantage, age, gender and lone parenthood but not ethnicity were significantly associated with onset of disabling chronic conditions. The SDI showed a finely graded association with onset of disabling chronic conditions in the index group (most disadvantaged OR 2.11 [CI 1.76 to 2.53]; disadvantaged in two domains OR 1.45 [CI 1.20 to 1.75]; disadvantaged in one domain OR 1.14 [CI 0.93 to 1.39] that was unaffected by age, gender and ethnicity and slightly attenuated by lone parenthood. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify socio-economic disadvantage in earlier childhood as a predisposing factor for onset of all-cause disabling chronic conditions in later childhood. Temporal ordering and gradation of the response indicate socio-economic disadvantage may play a causal role. This suggests that targeting preventative efforts to reduce socio-economic disadvantage in early childhood is likely to be an important public health strategy to decease health inequalities in later childhood and early adulthood.},

The objectives of this study were to examine patterns of exposure to poverty during the first 10 years of life in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) cohort according to three measures of poverty and to explore family characteristics associated with different poverty exposures. METHOD: Data from 1,334 participants from the QLSCD were collected annually at home from ages 5 months through 10 years. Household income (previous 12 months) and sources of income were recorded at each data round. Poverty status was operationalized as 1) living below the low income cut-off of Statistics Canada, 2) receiving social welfare and 3) being in the lowest quintile of socio-economic status. We plotted trends in the prevalence of child poverty over time. We used latent class growth modelling to identify subgroups with similar poverty trajectories. Duration of poverty according to each measure was computed separately for early childhood, middle childhood, and the entire 10 years of life. RESULTS: Four trajectories of poverty were identified: stable poor, decreasing likelihood, increasing likelihood, and never poor. The three measures of poverty do not cover the same population, yet the characteristics of those identified as poor are similar. Children of non-European, immigrant mothers were most likely to be poor, and there was a higher likelihood of children from single-parent families to live in chronic poverty during the first 10 years. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of children are exposed to poverty before 10 years of age. More effective public policies could reduce child poverty.},

English-learning infants (n = 48) were followed longitudinally from 18 to 24 months, using real-time measures of spoken language processing. The first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning in this diverse sample. The second goal was to examine differences in these crucial aspects of early language development in relation to family socioeconomic status (SES). The most important findings were that significant disparities in vocabulary and language processing efficiency were already evident at 18 months between infants from higher- and lower-SES families, and by 24 months there was a 6-month gap between SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.},

@article{Rai2012,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies in the United States consistently find autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to be overrepresented in high socioeconomic status (SES) families. These findings starkly contrast with SES gradients of many health conditions, and may result from SES inequalities in access to services. We hypothesized that prenatal measures of low, not high, parental SES would be associated with an increased risk of offspring ASD, once biases in case ascertainment are minimized. METHOD: We tested this hypothesis in a population-based study in Sweden, a country that has free universal healthcare, routine screening for developmental problems, and thorough protocols for diagnoses of ASD. In a case-control study nested in a total population cohort of children aged 0 to 17 years living in Stockholm County between 2001 and 2007 (N = 589,114), we matched ASD cases (n = 4,709) by age and sex to 10 randomly selected controls. We retrieved parental SES measures collected at time of birth by record linkage. RESULTS: Children of families with lower income, and of parents with manual occupations (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.3-1.6) were at higher risk of ASD. No important relationships with parental education were observed. These associations were present after accounting for parental ages, migration status, parity, psychiatric service use, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and birth characteristics; and regardless of comorbid intellectual disability. CONCLUSIONS: Lower, not higher, socioeconomic status was associated with an increased risk of ASD. Studies finding the opposite may be underestimating the burden of ASD in lower SES groups.},

@article{Urke2011,
	abstract = {This study investigated the association of parents' socioeconomic status (SES) with child stunting in the Peruvian Andes and in Peru nationally. It was hypothesized that the relationship of SES to child stunting would be weaker in the Andean compared with the national sample. This is consistent with earlier research indicating that the relationship of SES to health may be weak in poor regions. The data were from the Demographic and Health Survey 2004 to 2006. Two samples of children 3 to 60 months old were compared: a national sample (n = 1426) and an Andean sample (n = 543). Malnutrition was measured using the indicator "stunting," which is small stature for age. Socioeconomic status was measured using parental education, occupation, and household wealth index (WI). In both samples, SES was significantly related to stunting. The odds of stunting in the poorest WI quintile were significantly higher than in the richest quintile. The same pattern was observed in children of mothers having incomplete primary education compared with children of mothers having complete secondary or higher education. The odds of stunting were significantly lower in children of mothers working at home compared with mothers in professional occupations. The associations of WI and maternal education with stunting were significantly stronger in the Andean compared with the national sample; the study did not find support for the hypothesis. Even in very poor regions such as the Andes, SES may be associated with child health, suggesting the importance of public health measures to overcome the health disadvantages experienced by children living in low SES households.},

@article{Cox2012,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand the association of race/ethnicity with engagement in pediatric primary care and examine how any racial/ethnic disparities are influenced by socioeconomic status. METHODS: Visit videos and parent surveys were obtained for 405 children who visited for respiratory infections. Family and physician engagement in key visit tasks (relationship building, information exchange, and decision making) were coded. Two parallel regression models adjusting for covariates and clustering by physician were constructed: (1) race/ethnicity only and (2) race/ethnicity with SES (education and income). RESULTS: With and without adjustment for SES, physicians seeing Asian families spoke 24% fewer relationship building utterances, compared to physicians seeing White, non-Latino families (p<0.05). Latino families gathered 24% less information than White, non-Latino families (p<0.05), but accounting for SES mitigates this association. Similarly, African American families were significantly less likely to be actively engaged in decision making (OR=0.32; p<0.05), compared to White, non-Latino families, but adjusting for SES mitigated this association. CONCLUSION: While engagement during pediatric visits differed by the family's race/ethnicity, many of these differences were eliminated by accounting for socioeconomic status. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Effective targeting and evaluation of interventions to reduce health disparities through improving engagement must extend beyond race/ethnicity to consider socioeconomic status more broadly.},

@article{Johnson2011,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the relation between low birth weight and childhood family and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and disease onset in adulthood. METHODS: Using US nationally representative longitudinal data, we estimated hazard models of the onset of asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, heart attack, or heart disease. The sample contained 4387 children who were members of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in 1968; they were followed up to 2007, when they were aged 39 to 56 years. Our research design included sibling comparisons of disease onset among siblings with different birth weights. RESULTS: The odds ratios of having asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, heart attack, or heart disease by age 50 years for low-birth weight babies vs others were 1.64 (P < .01), 1.51 (P < .01), 2.09 (P < .01), and 2.16 (P < .01), respectively. Adult disease prevalence differed substantially by childhood socioeconomic status (SES). After accounting for childhood socioeconomic factors, we found a substantial hazard ratio of disease onset associated with low birth weight, which persisted for sibling comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood SES is strongly associated with the onset of chronic disease in adulthood. Low birth weight plays an important role in disease onset; this relation persists after an array of childhood socioeconomic factors is accounted for.},

@article{James1999,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of interpregnancy interval on the elevated risk of term small for gestational age (SGA) births to black women. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Delivery Interview Program, a hospital-based cohort study of 12,718 women conducted at the Boston Hospital for Women from 1977 to 1980. The current analysis was limited to black and white parous women who gave birth to term infants during the study and whose last previous pregnancies had also resulted in term, live births. There were 578 black and 3400 white women who met these criteria. The rates of term SGA births for black and white women were calculated according to six interpregnancy intervals (6 or less, 6-12, 12-24, 24-36, 36-60, or longer than 60 months). Multiple logistic regression was used to control for confounding. RESULTS: The overall rate of term SGA births was 6.4% for black women compared with 3.9% for white women (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 2.4). Black women were also more likely than white women to have interpregnancy intervals of 6 months or less (9.2% black, 4.8% white; RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4, 2.6). At every interpregnancy interval, black women had a higher rate of term SGA births than white women. After controlling for interpregnancy interval in a logistic regression analysis, the increased risk of SGA delivery among black women remained unchanged (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1, 2.5). CONCLUSION: Although black women were more likely than white women to have SGA births and short interpregnancy intervals, differences in interpregnancy intervals between the races did not explain the disparity in term SGA births.},

	abstract = {In the presence of time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment, standard statistical methods for failure time analysis may be biased. Methods that correctly adjust for this type of covariate include the parametric g-formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models, and g-estimation of structural nested accelerated failure time models. In this article, we propose a novel method to estimate the causal effect of a time-dependent treatment on failure in the presence of informative right-censoring and time-dependent confounders that may be affected by past treatment: g-estimation of structural nested cumulative failure time models (SNCFTMs). An SNCFTM considers the conditional effect of a final treatment at time m on the outcome at each later time k by modeling the ratio of two counterfactual cumulative risks at time k under treatment regimes that differ only at time m. Inverse probability weights are used to adjust for informative censoring. We also present a procedure that, under certain "no-interaction" conditions, uses the g-estimates of the model parameters to calculate unconditional cumulative risks under nondynamic (static) treatment regimes. The procedure is illustrated with an example using data from a longitudinal cohort study, in which the "treatments" are healthy behaviors and the outcome is coronary heart disease.},

Potential shortcomings in the design and implementation of RCTs are often mentioned in passing, yet most researchers consider that RCTs are always superior to all other types of evidence. This paper examines the limitations of RCTs and shows that some types of evidence commonly supposed to be inferior to all RCTs are actually superior to many. This has important consequences for research methodology, for quality of care in clinical medicine, and--especially--for research funding policy. Because every study design may have problems in particular applications, studies should be evaluated by appropriate criteria, and not primarily according to the simplistic RCT/non-RCT dichotomy promoted by some prominent advocates of the evidence-based medicine movement and by the research evaluation guidelines based on its principles.},

	abstract = {Social epidemiology is the study of relations between social factors and health status in populations. Although recent decades have witnessed a rapid development of this research program in scope and sophistication, causal inference has proven to be a persistent dilemma due to the natural assignment of exposure level based on unmeasured attributes of individuals, which may lead to substantial confounding. Some optimism has been expressed about randomized social interventions as a solution to this long-standing inferential problem. We review the causal inference problem in social epidemiology, and the potential for causal inference in randomized social interventions. Using the example of a currently on-going intervention that randomly assigns families to non-poverty housing, we review the limitations to causal inference even under experimental conditions and explain which causal effects become identifiable. We note the benefit of using the randomized trial as a conceptual model, even for design and interpretation of observational studies in social epidemiology.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a woman's educational level on starting and continuing breastfeeding and to assess the role of sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, psychosocial, and birth characteristics in this association. METHODS: We used the data of 2914 participants in a population-based prospective cohort study. Information on educational level, breastfeeding, sociodemographic (maternal age, single parenthood, parity, job status), lifestyle-related (BMI, smoking, alcohol use), psychosocial (whether the pregnancy was planned, stress), and birth (gestational age, birth weight, cesarean delivery, place and type of delivery) characteristics were obtained between pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of starting and continuing breastfeeding for educational level were obtained by logistic regression, adjusted for each group of covariates and for all covariates simultaneously. RESULTS: Of 1031 highest-educated mothers, 985 (95.5%) started breastfeeding; the percentage was 73.1% (255 of 349) in the lowest-educated mothers. At 6 months, 39.3% (405 of 1031) of highest-educated mothers and 15.2% (53 of 349) of lowest-educated mothers were still breastfeeding. Educationally related differences were present in starting breastfeeding and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 months but not in breastfeeding continuation between 2 and 6 months. Lifestyle-related and birth characteristics attenuated the association between educational level and breastfeeding, but the association was hardly affected by sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions to breastfeed were underlain by differences in educational background. The underlying pathways require further research. For the time being, interventions on promoting breastfeeding should start early in pregnancy and should increase their focus on low-educated women.},

This study enrolled black and white children under 5 years of age who were hospitalized for acute respiratory illness (ARI) in 3 US counties during October-May 2002-2009. Population-based rates of hospitalization were calculated by race for ARI and laboratory-confirmed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), using US Census denominators. Relative rates of hospitalization between racial groups were estimated. Of 1,415 hospitalized black children and 1,824 hospitalized white children with ARI enrolled in the study, 108 (8%) black children and 111 (6%) white children had influenza and 230 (19%) black children and 441 (29%) white children had RSV. Hospitalization rates were higher among black children than among white children for ARI (relative rate (RR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6, 1.8) and influenza (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6, 2.9). For RSV, rates were similar among black and white children under age 12 months but higher for black children aged 12 months or more (for ages 12-23 months, RR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.5; for ages 24-59 months, RR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.6). Black children versus white children were significantly more likely to have public insurance or no insurance (85% vs. 43%) and a history of asthma/wheezing (28% vs. 18%) but not more severe illness. The observed racial disparities require further study.},

Accordingly, we aimed to study the incidence and age related prevalence, socio-demographic risk factors and association between upper respiratory infection and nasopharyngeal colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae in the first year of life among rural Indian infants. METHODS: A birth cohort of 210 babies was evaluated monthly with nasopharyngeal swabbing to note the frequency of upper respiratory infection and carriage rate with S. pneumoniae. Data on 11 potential risk factors were noted and subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Upper respiratory infection episodes commenced within a few weeks of life and increased in frequency with age, peaking at 72% in the 9th month. There were 747 episodes of upper respiratory infection overall (6.1 episodes per child-year follow up). The prevalence was maximum in the winter months (65%). There were 3 significant risk factors for upper respiratory infection in the first year of life, i.e., winter season (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.4-3.5), nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.1-1.7) and parental occupation (OR=1.37; 95% CI=1.1-1.8). The OR were adjusted for other covariates like sex of the child, parents' education, type of house, birth weight, number of family members, passive smoking, use of firewood for cooking and water source. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal predilection in winter, nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae and parental occupation (poor socioeconomic status) are the most important risk factors for upper respiratory infection among rural Indian infants.},

	abstract = {AIM: To examine socio-economic factors, smoking, coffee consumption and exclusive breastfeeding duration. METHODS: This study was part of a prospective cohort study of children born between 1 October 1997 and 1 October 1999 (the All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) study). Eleven socio-economic characteristics (parental employment, civil status, whether parents were born in Sweden, parental education, residence at birth and during child's first year, crowded living), maternal smoking, coffee consumption, infant sex, siblings, parental age, and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy were analysed using logistic regression and Cox's proportional hazards method. All data were obtained through questionnaires distributed at infant birth and at 1 y of age. Exclusive breastfeeding duration<4 mo and actual breastfeeding duration were our main outcome measures. RESULTS: Out of 10205 infants, 2206 (21.6%) were exclusively breastfed for less than 4 mo ("short exclusive breastfeeding"; SEBF). Backward stepwise regression analysis identified the following risk factors for SEBF: maternal smoking (95% confidence interval for adjusted odds ratio, 95% CI AOR 2.00-2.82), low maternal education (95% CI AOR 1.45-2.19), maternal employment less than 3 mo during pregnancy (95% CI AOR 1.17-1.54), paternal age<or=29 y (95% CI AOR 1.14-1.47), maternal age<or=29 y (95% CI AOR 1.08-1.39) and low paternal education (95% CI AOR 1.08-1.48). The odds ratio for SEBF increased with the number of cigarettes smoked. Coffee consumption was not associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that socio-economic factors and smoking may be of importance to the risk of breastfeeding exclusively for less than 4 mo, while coffee consumption is not.},

METHOD: A follow-up study of children born to primigravidae living in Dundee and booked into antenatal clinics in the City of Dundee (Local Authority District) from 1 May 1985 to 30 April 1986. The study population was 846 first born singletons, of whom 592 attended for developmental assessment at age 18 months. The main outcome measures were the Bayley Scales of Infant Mental and Motor Development. RESULTS: Higher mental development was significantly related to breast feeding on discharge from hospital and according to the health visitors' notes at about 2 weeks after discharge after allowing for partner's social class, mother's education, height, alcohol and cigarette consumption; placental weight and the child's sex, birth weight and gestational age at birth. After adjustment for statistically significant variables, the difference in Bayley mental development index between breast and bottle fed infants was between 3.7 and 5.7 units depending on the source of feeding data. No differences were found for psychomotor development or behaviour. CONCLUSION: The study provides further evidence of a robust statistical association between type of feeding and child intelligence. However, the literature is replete with suggestions for potential confounding variables which offer alternative causal explanations. To unravel what is an important clinical and public health question, further research should concentrate on randomized trials of supplemented formula feeds for children of mothers opting for bottle feeding and on epidemiological studies designed to disentangle the relation between method of feeding, parental intelligence and social environment.},

METHOD: Participants in this study were a population-based birth cohort in the city of Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain). Females were recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy between July 2004 and July 2006. Information about parental characteristics and breastfeeding was obtained through questionnaires. Full breastfeeding was categorized as never, short term (</=4mo), long term (4-6mo), or very long term (>6mo). A trained psychologist assessed the neuropsychological development of children at 4 years of age (n=434) using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA). RESULTS: Full breastfeeding showed an independent association with child general MSCA scores after adjusting for a range of social, psychological, and nutritional factors (>6mo, coefficient=7.4 [95% confidence interval=2.8-12.0], p=0.011). Maternal social class, education level, and IQ were also associated with child neuropsychological scores, but did not explain breastfeeding associations. Omega-3 (n3) fatty acid levels were not associated with child neuropsychological scores. INTERPRETATION: Very long-term full breastfeeding was independently associated with neuropsychological functions of children at 4 years of age. Maternal indicators of intelligence, psychopathology, and colostrum n3 fatty acids did not explain this association.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the association between neighborhood context and breastfeeding among a sample of predominately unmarried urban mothers, a group with relatively low rates of breastfeeding. METHODS: This study combines census tract information with data from 2 waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 4228) to predict the odds of initiating and sustaining breastfeeding. RESULTS: Findings indicate that neighborhood socioeconomic composition, rather than racial or ethnic concentration, is associated with breastfeeding behaviors. More specifically, living in a highly educated neighborhood is associated with higher odds of initiating and sustaining breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the breastfeeding behaviors of urban mothers vary according to neighborhood educational context. Understanding how breastfeeding behaviors are shaped by one's neighborhood environment will allow public health initiatives to more effectively target vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Many early life risk factors for childhood obesity are more prevalent among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and may explain the higher prevalence of obesity among racial/ethnic minority children. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in adiposity and overweight are explained by differences in risk factors during pregnancy (gestational diabetes and depression), infancy (rapid infant weight gain, feeding other than exclusive breastfeeding, and early introduction of solid foods), and early childhood (sleeping &lt;12 h/d, presence of a television set in the room where the child sleeps, and any intake of sugar-sweetened beverages or fast food). DESIGN Prospective prebirth cohort study. SETTING Multisite group practice in Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS Participants included 1116 mother-child pairs (63% white, 17% black, and 4% Hispanic) EXPOSURE Mother's report of child's race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score, total fat mass index from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and overweight or obesity, defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher at age 7 years. RESULTS Black (0.48 U [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64]) and Hispanic (0.43 [0.12 to 0.74]) children had higher BMI z scores, as well as higher total fat mass index and overweight/obesity prevalence, than white children. After adjustment for socioeconomic confounders and parental BMI, differences in BMI z score were attenuated for black and Hispanic children (0.22 U [0.05 to 0.40] and 0.22 U [-0.08 to 0.52], respectively). Adjustment for pregnancy risk factors did not substantially change these estimates. However, after further adjustment for infancy and childhood risk factors, we observed only minimal differences in BMI z scores between whites, blacks (0.07 U [-0.11 to 0.26]), and Hispanics (0.04 U [-0.27 to 0.35]). We observed similar attenuation of racial/ethnic differences in adiposity and prevalence of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood adiposity and obesity are determined by factors operating in infancy and early childhood. Efforts to reduce obesity disparities should focus on preventing early life risk factors.},

	abstract = {WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Children from low socioeconomic households are at greater risk of obesity. Children predominantly breastfed have a reduced risk of early childhood obesity. Yet, it is not known how feeding patterns mediate the relationship between social class and obesity. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Based on a nationally representative, longitudinal study of early childhood, this study finds that healthy infant feeding practices, including predominant breastfeeding, mediates the negative association between social class and obesity at 24 months. BACKGROUND: Children from low socioeconomic households are at greater risk of obesity. As breastfeeding can protect against child obesity, disadvantaged infants are less likely to breastfeed relative to more advantaged children. Whether infant feeding patterns, as well as other maternal characteristics mediate the association between social class and obesity has not been established in available research. OBJECTIVES: Examine the impact of infant feeding practices on child obesity and identify the mechanisms that link socioeconomic status (SES) with child obesity. METHODS: Based on a nationally representative longitudinal survey (ECLS-B) of early childhood (n = 8030), we examine how breastfeeding practices, the early introduction of solid foods and putting an infant to bed with a bottle mediate the relationship between social class and early childhood obesity relative to the mediating influence of other maternal characteristics (BMI, age at birth, smoking, depression and daycare use). RESULTS: Infants predominantly fed formula for the first 6 months were about 2.5 times more likely to be obese at 24 months of age relative to infants predominantly fed breast milk. The early introduction of solid foods (< 4 months) and putting the child to bed with a bottle also increased the likelihood of obesity. Unhealthy infant feeding practices were the primary mechanism mediating the relationship between SES and early childhood obesity. Results are consistent across measures of child obesity although the effect size of infant feeding practices varies. CONCLUSIONS: The encouragement and support of breastfeeding and other healthy feeding practices are especially important for low socioeconomic children who are at increased risk of early childhood obesity. Targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers for breastfeeding support and for infant-led feeding strategies may reduce the negative association between SES and child obesity. The implications are discussed in terms of policy and practice.},

Participants were women 12-49 y and their <2-y-old children (2953 in 2006 and 3191 in 1999). Indicators were estimated with the status quo method. The median age of introduction of foods was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method using recall data. The national median duration of breastfeeding was similar in both surveys, 9.7 mo in 1999 and 10.4 mo in 2006, but decreased in the vulnerable population. In 1999 indigenous women breastfed 20.8 mo but did so for only 13.0 mo in 2006. The national percentage of those exclusively breastfeeding <6 mo also remained stable: 20% in 1999 and 22.3% in 2006. Nevertheless, exclusively breastfeeding <6 mo changed within the indigenous population, from 46% in 1999 to 34.5% in 2006. Between surveys, most breastfeeding indicators had lower values in vulnerable populations than in those better-off. Complementary feeding, however, improved overall. Complementary feeding was inadequately timed: median age of introduction of plain water was 3 mo, formula and non-human milk was 5 mo, and cereals, legumes, and animal foods was 5 mo. Late introduction of animal foods occurred among vulnerable indigenous population when 50% consumed these products at 8 mo. Mexican IYCFP indicate that public policy must protect breastfeeding while promoting the timely introduction of complementary feeding.},

@article{Howe2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cohort members tend to be healthy and affluent compared with the whole population, some studies indicate this does not bias certain exposure-outcome associations. It is less clear whether this holds when socioeconomic position (SEP) is the exposure of interest. METHODS: As an illustrative example, we use data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We calculate estimates of maternal education inequalities in outcomes for which data are available on almost the whole cohort (birth weight and length, breastfeeding, preterm birth, maternal obesity, smoking during pregnancy, educational attainment). These are calculated for the full cohort (n~12,000) and in restricted subsamples defined by continued participation at age 10 years (n approximately 7,000) and age 15 years (n approximately 5,000). RESULTS: Loss to follow-up was related both to SEP and outcomes. For each outcome, loss to follow-up was associated with underestimation of inequality, which increased as participation rates decreased (eg, mean birth-weight difference between highest and lowest SEP was 116 g [95% confidence interval = 78 to 153] in the full sample and 93 g [45 to 141] and 62 g [5 to 119] in those attending at ages 10 and 15 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable attrition from cohort studies may result in biased estimates of socioeconomic inequalities, and the degree of bias may worsen as participation rates decrease. However, even with considerable attrition (>50%), qualitative conclusions about the direction and approximate magnitude of inequalities did not change among most of our examples. The appropriate analysis approaches to alleviate bias depend on the missingness mechanism.},

	abstract = {AIM: Revised infant dietary recommendations from the Icelandic Nutrition Council (Nutrition: the first twelve months. Reykjavik, Iceland: The Icelandic Nutrition Council, 2003) are outlined in a booklet provided during free postnatal care. These focus on increasing the duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding and reducing cow's milk consumption. This study explored whether maternal education and other parental factors affected whether mothers followed the recommendations. METHODS: Mothers of randomly selected healthy infants (n = 200) completed questionnaires on body mass index (BMI), age, education (basic, medium and higher), household income, smoking and parental factors. Dietary data were collected during home visits by a researcher (0-4 months) and through monthly food records completed by parents or caregivers (5-12 months). RESULTS: Each maternal education level increased breastfeeding duration by 0.72 months (95% CI = 0.04, 1.39) and reduced cow's milk consumption by 36.7 mL/day (95% CI = -70.11, -3.03), when adjusted for maternal BMI, age, smoking and family income. Maternal education was not associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding was inversely associated with maternal BMI, B = -0.10 (95% CI = -0.16, -0.05) and -0.13 (95% CI = -0.23, -0.03), respectively. CONCLUSION: Mothers with higher education appear to have adapted more easily to the revised recommendations on infant diet, particularly when their infants are 6-12 months old. Higher maternal BMI was associated with shorter duration of both exclusive and total breastfeeding.},

We investigated the association of socioeconomic status with blood pressure and prehypertension in childhood. In a prospective cohort, 3024 five- to six-year-old children had blood pressure measurements and available information on potential explanatory factors, namely birth weight, gestational age, smoking during pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, familial hypertension, maternal body mass index, breastfeeding duration, domestic tobacco exposure, and body mass index. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures of children from mid-educated women were 1.0-mm Hg higher (95% CI, 0.4-1.7) and 0.9-mm Hg higher (95% CI, 0.3-1.4), and the blood pressures of children with low-educated women were 2.2-mm Hg higher (95% CI, 1.4-3.0) and 1.7-mm Hg higher (95% CI, 1.1-2.4) compared with children with high-educated women. Children with mid- (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18-1.92) or low-educated mothers (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.35-2.42) were more likely to have prehypertension compared with children with high-educated mothers. Using path analyses, birth weight, breastfeeding duration, and body mass index were determined as having a role in the association of maternal education with offspring blood pressure and prehypertension. The socioeconomic gradient in hypertension appears to emerge from childhood as the results show a higher blood pressure and more prehypertension in children from lower socioeconomic status families. Socioeconomic disparities could be reduced by improving 3 factors in particular, namely birth weight, breastfeeding duration, and body mass index, but other factors might also play a role.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with a variety of risks on fetal health, whereas breastfeeding may protect infants from infections in the early postpartum period. Little has been reported regarding their associations with children's general health later in childhood. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Parent-rated children's general health status was investigated among 14,836 children and adolescents 3-17 years old who participated in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) in 2003-2006. Data on breastfeeding and maternal smoking during pregnancy were collected by parent-administered questionnaires. SPSS complex samples logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Exclusive breastfeeding and non-exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy were associated with better health status overall among all children in the KiGGS (both p<0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including other prior and current exposures, exclusive breastfeeding over 6 months remained significant overall among all children (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.38) and in the age groups 7-10 years (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60) and 11-17 years (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.50), while non-exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy remained significant in the age group 11-17 years only (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.06-2.10). CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breastfeeding and non-exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy may be associated with better children's general health status later in childhood, particularly when children reach adolescence. Further studies are required to elucidate these possible and biologically plausible associations. Health professionals should take opportunities to promote breastfeeding and cessation of smoking among (expectant) mothers for a healthy future of their children.},

The purpose of the current study was to examine the parent-reported health of Inuit children under 6 years of age living in Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the 2006 Aboriginal Children's Survey were used to examine measures of Inuit child health as rated by parents including child health, limitations to physical activity, chronic conditions, ear infections, and dental problems. Associations between social determinants of health and parent-rated Inuit child health were also explored. RESULTS: Most Inuit children under age 6 were reported by their parents or guardians to be in excellent or very good health. The most common chronic conditions identified were asthma, speech and language difficulties, allergies, lactose intolerance, and hearing impairment. Several social determinants of health were associated with child health, including parental education, household income, breastfeeding, and perceived housing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that social determinants of health, including both socio-economic and household characteristics, are associated with Inuit child health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the benefits of breastfeeding (BF), healthcare institutions recommend that a child should be breastfed for the first 6 months of its life. This study provides a review of BF as a function of socioeconomic criteria in various industrialized countries. METHODS: A review was carried out between 1st January 1998 and 1st March 2009, using Medline and the Public Health Database. The papers were selected independently by two persons, using a methodological grid designed to evaluate the quality of the studies. From 1126 initially selected papers, 26 from 16 different countries were retained for further analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of exclusive BF initiation was the highest in Norway, Denmark, and Japan with, respectively, 99, 98.7, and 98.3%. This prevalence was the lowest in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France with, respectively, 70, 69.5, and 62.6%. Women who breastfeed less were most commonly found to be young, single, from a low socioeconomic group, or with a low level of education. Women from immigrant population groups breastfed more than the native-born population during their pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the sociodemographic distribution of women who breastfeed is essential for the definition of preventive policies, which are needed to reduce health-related social inequalities. An in-depth analysis of existing primary healthcare programs would allow new strategies to be defined.},

OBJECTIVE: Purpose of the study was to evaluate alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, tobacco smoke exposure and caffeine consumption in breastfeeding women from Masovian Province. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The survey was conducted from September 2010 till March 2011. The study group consisted of 102 breastfeeding women aged 19-38 years. Information on alcohol consumption, smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke was obtained by questionnaire interview. The results about caffeine intake were obtained using 3-day dietary records method and food frequency questionnaire method. Source of information about the caffeine content in products were the published literature, in the case of energy drinks the manufacturer's label. RESULTS: Among all women surveyed (n = 102), up 17% of respondents declared alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking of 6% and 15% of passive exposure to tobacco smoke. The average caffeine consumption in a group called "caffeine consumers" (n = 94) was 127.4 +/- 76.0 mg/person/day for 3-day dietary records method and 163.4 +/- 100.6 mg/person/day for the food frequency questionnaire method. The correlation coefficient between the used methods was r = 0.71 (p < 0.001). The main sources of caffeine, regardless of the method of data collection were: black tea, which provided about 60% of caffeine and ground coffee (about 20%) and instant coffee (about 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite general knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking cigarette/tobacco smoke exposure and the consumption of alcohol and foods high in caffeine, some respondents did not halt the use of these stimulants during lactation, indicating a need for an education in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One potential method of improving outcome for pregnant or postpartum women with a drug or alcohol problem is with home visits. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of home visits during pregnancy and/or after birth for women with a drug or alcohol problem. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 30 November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 30 November 2011), CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2011) and PsycINFO (1974 to 30 November 2011) supplemented by searches of citations from previous reviews and trials and contact with experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies using random or quasi-random allocation of pregnant or postpartum women with a drug or alcohol problem to home visits. Trials enrolling high-risk women of whom more than 50% were reported to use drugs or alcohol were also eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors performed assessments of trials independently. We performed statistical analyses using fixed-effect and random-effects models where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies (reporting 803 mother-infant pairs) compared home visits mostly after birth with no home visits. Visitors included community health nurses, paediatric nurses, trained counsellors, paraprofessional advocates, midwives and lay African-American women. Several studies had significant methodological limitations. There was no significant difference in continued illicit drug use (three studies, 384 women; risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.24), continued alcohol use (three studies, 379 women; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.46), failure to enrol in a drug treatment program (two studies, 211 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.94), not breastfeeding at six months (two studies, 260 infants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10), incomplete six-month infant vaccination schedule (two studies, 260 infants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32), the Bayley Mental Development Index (three studies, 199 infants; mean difference 2.89, 95% CI -1.17 to 6.95) or Psychomotor Index (MD 3.14, 95% CI -0.03 to 6.32), child behavioural problems (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01), infants not in care of biological mother (two studies, 254 infants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.39), non-accidental injury and non-voluntary foster care (two studies, 254 infants; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23) or infant death (three studies, 288 infants; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.16). Individual studies reported a significant reduction in involvement with child protective services (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74) and failure to use postpartum contraception (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.82).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytokines in breast milk may play crucial roles in the beneficial effects of breastfeeding in protecting against allergic and infectious diseases in infants. In particular, breast milk-borne transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has an important potential role in developing the mucosal immune system in infants. However, little is known about what factors influence TGF-beta expression in human milk. We investigated whether the behavioral and psychosocial characteristics of mothers affect breast milk TGF-beta levels. METHODS: We conducted a survey of all 139 mothers who were lactating between February and October 2010 in Koshu City, Japan. Participants completed a questionnaire and provided breast milk at the health checkups for their 3-month-old child (N = 129, 93%). Breast milk was assayed for total TGF-beta2 levels by ELISA. We took an exploratory approach based on linear and ordered logistic regressions to model TGF-beta2 concentrations with their multiple potential determinants. RESULTS: Mothers with depression or poor self-rated health had higher TGF-beta2 concentrations than mothers without depression (odds ratio for a higher TGF-beta2 quartile: 3.11, 95% confidence intervals: 1.03-9.37) or those reporting better health (odds ratio: 2.34, 1.21-4.55). Smoking, drinking alcohol, probiotics supplementation, social support, and maternal history of allergic diseases were not associated with milk TGF-beta2 levels. Milk gathered between August and October or later in the afternoon (3-4 pm vs. 12-2 pm) contained less TGF-beta2. CONCLUSION: Depression, as the consequence of psychosocial stress, may be a strong determinant of TGF-beta levels in breast milk. Seasonal and daily fluctuations in milk TGF-beta2 concentrations warrant further study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and combined occurrence of peri-conceptional folic acid (FA) supplement use, smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a sample of women in Dublin, and determine the factors associated with these health behaviours. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A prospective observational study (2004-2006) involving the recruitment of 491 pregnant women from antenatal clinics in a Dublin maternity hospital, with postpartum follow-up of 450 eligible mothers. Data on FA use, maternal smoking and alcohol consumption patterns during pregnancy were collected from the antenatal patient-administered questionnaire, which was completed by participants, and returned to the investigator on the day of recruitment. RESULTS: The median gestational age of women at recruitment was 36 weeks. A combined 24.2% of mothers commenced FA at the recommended time, avoided alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy. In all, 35.3% of mothers reported to consuming alcohol, 20.9% smoked during pregnancy and 44.4% commenced FA at the recommended time. Mothers <25 years were more likely to have not taken FA at the recommended time (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64-9.77) and were more likely to have smoked during pregnancy (aOR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.32-9.57). Irish nationality positively predicted both alcohol consumption (aOR: 4.37, 95% CI: 1.88-10.15) and smoking (aOR: 10.92, 95% CI: 1.35-87.98) during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Educational efforts are still necessary to convince women of Irish nationality, in particular, of the adverse effects of smoking and alcohol consumption on fetal outcome. Women <25 years should be specifically targeted in smoking cessation and FA promotional campaigns.},

	abstract = {Prior research revealed that breast stimulation altered the way the lactating body handles alcohol. Its effects depended upon when it occurred relative to drinking. The goal of the present study was to determine whether breast pumping works independently of the physiological and metabolic changes that accompany lactation. To this end, we tested 12 women when they were exclusively breastfeeding 3-5-month-old infants and then again several months after lactation had ceased. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups that differed in the timing of breast pumping relative to drinking a 0.4g/kg dose of alcohol: one group breast pumped 0.6h after drinking (pumped after group) and the other pumped 1h before drinking (pumped before group). For each reproductive stage, subjects were tested on 2 separate days, consuming a standardized meal 1 h before drinking during 1 test day and remaining fasted during the other. Breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) and temperature readings were obtained before and at fixed intervals after drinking. Pumping before drinking significantly decreased BrAC during both reproductive stages, whereas pumping after drinking resulted in different BrAC time curves during lactation when compared with after lactation. That is, levels were significantly lower during the descending phase of the time curve during than after lactation. The interactions between pumping and reproductive stage were most apparent during fed condition. Furthermore, women were more sensitive to hypothermic effects of both fasting and drinking alcohol during lactation. These findings add to the growing literature that lactating women metabolize alcohol differently, in part, due to the frequent breast stimulation during breastfeeding and the pronounced physiological changes that accompany one of the most energetically costly mammalian activities.},

METHODS: We analyzed the most recent data available, which were from the 1993-1994 Food and Drug Administration Infant Feeding Practices Study I, a longitudinal panel study of infant-mother pairs. Self-reported data on alcohol consumption were analyzed for 772 breastfeeding women and 776 non-breastfeeding women age > or =14 years. RESULTS: At 3 months postpartum, 36% of breastfeeding women and 40% of non-breastfeeding women consumed alcohol (p = 0.09). In multinomial regression models adjusted for age, race, education, income, marital status, region, smoking, and alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, breastfeeding women were significantly less likely than non-breastfeeding women to consume two drinks per week (p < 0.01), or equal to or more than three drinks per week (p < 0.01), but equally likely to consume one drink (p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of breastfeeding women consumed alcohol. Their infants may or may not have been exposed, as some women may have used alcohol avoidance strategies. Nationally representative data are needed on alcohol consumption and infant feeding practices among breastfeeding women.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Australian alcohol consumption data for women during the period of pregnancy and lactation is limited. The purpose of this paper is to provide current alcohol consumption data for pregnant and lactating women in Perth, Western Australia (WA). Data were collected from 587 women between mid-September 2002 and mid-July 2003. DESIGN AND METHODS: Women from two public hospitals with maternity wards in the Perth metropolitan area completed a self-administered baseline questionnaire while in hospital or shortly after discharge. All women, regardless of their chosen infant feeding method, were followed-up by telephone interview at 4, 10, 16, 22, 32, 40 and 52 weeks postpartum. Data were analysed to determine alcohol use patterns of the women during the period of pregnancy and lactation and results were compared to national guidelines for alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Approximately 32% of women stopped drinking alcohol during pregnancy. A remaining 35% of pregnant women consumed alcohol during pregnancy, with 82.2% of these women consuming up to two standard drinks per week. At 4, 6 and 12 months postpartum, 46.7%, 47.4% and 42.3% of breastfeeding women were consuming alcohol, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The majority of breastfeeding women consumed up to two standard drinks per week, which is within levels recommended by national authorities. There is, however, a small proportion of women consuming alcohol at levels above national recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. The development of 'safe' alcohol intake practices, within national recommendations, during the postnatal period would remove any potential health risks to the infant from alcohol exposure at this vulnerable growth stage.},

@article{Pepino2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the physiological adaptations of the digestive system during lactation, the present study tested the hypothesis that lactation alters alcohol pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Lactating women who were exclusively breastfeeding a 2- to 5-month-old infant and 2 control groups of nonlactating women were studied. The first control group consisted of women who were exclusively formula-feeding similarly aged infants, whereas the other consisted of women who had never given birth. A within-subjects design study was conducted such that women drank a 0.4 g/kg dose of alcohol following a 12-hour overnight fast during one test session (fasted condition) or 60 minutes after consuming a standard breakfast during the other (fed condition). Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels and mood states were obtained at fixed intervals before and after alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Under both conditions, the resultant BAC levels at each time point were significantly lower and the area under the blood alcohol time curve were significantly smaller in lactating women when compared with the 2 groups of nonlactating women. That such changes were due to lactation per se and not due to recent parturient events was suggested by the finding that alcohol pharmacokinetics of nonlactating mothers, who were tested at a similar time postpartum, were no different from women who had never given birth. Despite lower BAC levels in lactating mothers, there were no significant differences among the 3 groups of women in the stimulant effects of alcohol. However, lactating women did differ in the sedative effects of alcohol when compared with nulliparous but not formula-feeding mothers. That is, both groups of parous women felt sedated for shorter periods of time when compared with nulliparous women. CONCLUSIONS: The systemic availability of alcohol was diminished during lactation. However, the reduced availability of alcohol in lactating women did not result in corresponding changes in the subjective effects of alcohol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One potential method of improving outcome for pregnant or postpartum women with a drug or alcohol problem is with home visits. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of home visits during pregnancy and/or after birth for pregnant women with a drug or alcohol problem. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (30 April 2004), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 16, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004), citations from previous reviews and trials, and contacted expert informants. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies using random or quasi-random allocation of pregnant or postpartum women with a drug or alcohol problem to home visits. Trials enrolling high-risk women of whom more than 50% were reported to use drugs or alcohol were also eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessments of trials were performed independently by all review authors. Statistical analyses were performed using fixed and random-effects models where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies (709 women) compared home visits after birth with no home visits. None provided a significant antenatal component of home visits. The visitors included community health nurses, pediatric nurses, trained counsellors, paraprofessional advocates, midwives and lay African-American women. Most studies had methodological limitations, particularly large losses to follow up. There were no significant differences in continued illicit drug use (2 studies, 248 women; relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.20), continued alcohol use (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.41) failure to enrol in a drug treatment program (2 studies, 211 women; RR 0.45 95% CI 0.10 to 1.94). There was no significant difference in the Bayley MDI (3 studies, 199 infants; weighted mean difference 2.89, 95% CI -1.17 to 6.95) or Psychomotor Index (WMD 3.14, 95% CI -0.03 to 6.32). Other outcomes reported by one study only included breastfeeding at six months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23), incomplete six-month infant vaccination schedule (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.96), non-accidental injury and non-voluntary foster care (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23), failure to use postpartum contraception (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.82), child behavioural problems (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01), and involvement with child protective services (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of home visits for women with a drug or alcohol problem. Further large, high-quality trials are needed, and women's views on home visiting need to be assessed.},

@article{Little2002a,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate a previous study of 1-year-olds that reported a deficit in motor development associated with moderate alcohol use during lactation, using a different but comparable population. METHODOLOGY: The mental development of 915 18-month-old toddlers from a random sample of a longitudinal population-based study in the United Kingdom was measured using the Griffiths Developmental Scales. Frequent self-administered questionnaires during and after pregnancy provided maternal data. The dose of alcohol available to the lactating infant was obtained by multiplying the alcohol intake of the mother by the proportion of breast milk in the infant's diet. We compared this dose with the Griffiths Scales of Mental Development, taking into account potentially confounding variables. RESULT: Three of the Griffiths scales increased slightly but significantly with increasing infant alcohol exposure; there was no association in the remaining 2 or average of the scales. DISCUSSION: We were unable to replicate the earlier deficit in motor skills associated with lactation alcohol use. One reason may be that the dose of alcohol reaching the lactating infant is small, and tests of infants and toddlers have limited ability to pick up small effects. Studies of older children may resolve the question of the safety of drinking while nursing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contrary to the folklore which claims that drinking alcohol during lactation benefits both mother and infant, previous research in our laboratory revealed that breastfed infants consumed significantly less milk during the immediate hours after their mothers' consumption of an alcoholic beverage. Because breastfed infants are clearly capable of regulating milk intake, the present study tested the hypothesis that infants would compensate for the diminished milk intake if their mothers then refrained from drinking alcohol. METHODS: A within-subjects design that controlled for time of day was implemented because of the great individual and daily variation in both milk composition and intake. To this end, 12 exclusively breastfed infants and their mothers were tested on 2 days separated by 1 week. Each woman drank a 0.3 g/kg dose of alcohol in orange juice on one testing day and orange juice alone on the other; the order was counterbalanced. The infants' behaviors were monitored for the next 16 hr, the first 4 hr of monitoring on each test day occurred at the Monell Center. The infants fed on demand and immediately before and after each feeding, infants were weighed without a change in clothing. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, infants consumed significantly less milk during the 4 hr immediately after exposure to alcohol in mothers' milk compared with the control condition. Compensatory increases in intake were then observed during the 8 to 16 hr after exposure when mothers refrained from drinking alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that short-term exposure to small amounts of alcohol in mothers' milk produces distinctive changes in the infants' patterns of feeding.},

The present study tested the hypothesis that maternal alcohol consumption decreases the amount of milk available to the infant and alters milk composition in the short term. To this aim, 22 lactating women were tested on 2 days separated by 1 week; the women reported that they drank very little during pregnancy, but significantly increased alcohol intake during lactation. Each woman drank a 0.3 g/kg dose of alcohol in orange juice on one testing day and orange juice alone on the other; the order was counterbalanced. Immediately before drinking the beverage (baseline) and 2 hr after (postconsumption), women expressed their milk by using an electric breast pump until no milk had been secreted from either breast for 5 min. Although there was no difference in the energy content of the milk, maternal alcohol consumption slightly, but significantly, reduced the amount of milk produced by the lactating mother. These findings underscore the importance of determining whether and when infants compensate for the reductions in intake experienced at the breast following maternal alcohol consumption and how such changes impact on mother-infant interaction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that exposure to alcohol in breast milk affects infants' sleep and activity levels in the short term. METHODS: Thirteen lactating women and their infants were tested on 2 days, separated by an interval of 1 week. On each testing day, the mother expressed 100 mL of milk, while a small, computerized movement detector called an actigraph was placed on the infant's left leg to monitor sleep and activity patterning. After the actigraph had been in place for approximately 15 minutes, the infants ingested their mother's breast milk flavored with alcohol (32 mg) on one testing day and breast milk alone on the other. The infants' behaviors were monitored for the next 3.5 hours. RESULTS: The infants spent significantly less time sleeping during the 3.5 hours after consuming the alcohol-flavored milk (78.2 minutes compared with 56.8 minutes after feeding alcohol in breast milk). This reduction was apparently attributable to a shortening in the longest sleeping bout (34.5 compared with 56.7 minutes for sleeping after breast milk alone) and the amount of time spent in active sleep (25.8 minutes compared with 44.2 minutes after breast milk alone); the decrease in active sleep was observed in all but 2 of the 13 infants tested. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying the reduction in sleep remain to be elucidated, this study shows that short-term exposure to small amounts of alcohol in breast milk produces distinctive changes in the infant's sleep-wake patterning.},

	abstract = {Contrary to medical folklore, previous research has demonstrated that alcohol consumption by lactating women diminished milk intake by their infants during breast feeding. To determine whether this decrease in milk consumption was due to the infants responding to the altered flavor of the milk that also resulted, we evaluated the infants' intake and sucking responses to alcohol-flavored human milk outside of the context of breast feeding, thereby separating the changes due to the infants response to the flavor from any other changes that could also result from acute maternal alcohol consumption such as alterations in milk ejection or the composition of milk. The testing procedure consisted of a two-bottle preference test that was composed of four, 60-sec trials in which the mother's milk flavored with alcohol was alternated with the mother's milk alone in an ABBA or BAAB design. Attached to the nipple of each bottle was a transducer that responded to pressure changes produced by the infants' suckling. There was no suppression of sucking or intake in response to the ethanol-flavored milk. Rather, the infants consumed significantly more and sucked more frequently when drinking the alcohol-flavored milk compared with the unaltered milk. That experience with the flavor of alcohol in mothers' milk modified the infants' responses to alcohol flavor is suggested by the relationship between the reported frequency of mothers' drinking during lactation and the infants' rhythm and frequency of sucking when feeding the alcohol-flavored milk. These findings indicate that infants can readily detect the flavor of alcohol in mother's milk but that the decrease in consumption at the breast after maternal alcohol consumption is apparently not due to the infants rejecting the flavor of alcohol in their mothers' milk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The amount of alcohol ingested by a breast-fed infant is only a small fraction of that consumed by its mother, but even this small amount may have an effect on the infant. We investigated whether the ingestion of alcohol by a lactating woman altered the odor of her milk and whether exposure to a small amount of alcohol in the mother's milk had immediate effects on the behavior of the infant. METHODS: Twelve lactating women and their infants were tested on two days separated by an interval of one week. On each testing day, the mother expressed a small quantity of breast milk and then drank either orange juice or orange juice containing a small quantity of ethanol (0.3 g per kilogram of body weight). Additional milk samples were obtained at fixed intervals after the ingestion of the beverage and analyzed to determine their ethanol content. The samples were also evaluated by a panel of adults to determine whether any difference in the odor of the milk was detectable after alcohol ingestion. The infants were weighed before and after nursing to assess the amount of milk they ingested, and their behavior during breast-feeding was monitored by videotape. RESULTS: Short-term alcohol consumption by lactating women significantly and uniformly increased the perceived intensity of the odor of their milk as assessed by the panel; this increase in the intensity of the odor peaked 30 minutes to 1 hour after the alcohol was consumed and decreased thereafter. The alteration in the odor of the milk closely paralleled the changes in the concentration of ethanol in the milk (mean range, 0 to 6.9 mmol per liter [0 to 32 mg per deciliter]). The infants sucked more frequently during the first minute of feedings after their mothers had consumed alcohol (67.0 +/- 6.5 sucks, as compared with 58.4 +/- 5.9 sucks for feedings after the consumption of the nonalcoholic beverage; P less than 0.05), but they consumed significantly less milk (120.4 +/- 9.5 ml vs. 156.4 +/- 8.2 ml, P less than 0.001) during the testing sessions in which their mothers drank the alcoholic beverage. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying this reduction in milk intake remain to be elucidated, this study shows that short-term alcohol consumption by nursing mothers has an immediate effect on the sensory characteristics (odor) of their milk and the feeding behavior of their infants.},

	abstract = {The detrimental effects of maternal drinking during pregnancy on fetal health have been documented. The consequences for infants of maternal drinking during breast-feeding are unknown, but research in animals suggests that the infant could be affected by exposure to alcohol through the mother's milk. In a study of 400 infants born to members of a health maintenance organization, we investigated the relation of the mother's use of alcohol during breast-feeding to the infant's development at one year of age. Mental development, as measured by the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI), was unrelated to maternal drinking during breast-feeding. However, motor development, as measured by the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), was significantly lower in infants exposed regularly to alcohol in breast milk (after alcohol exposure during gestation was controlled for), with a dose-response relation (P for linear trend, 0.006). The infants of breast-feeding mothers who had at least one drink daily had a mean PDI score of 98, whereas the infants exposed to less alcohol in breast milk had a mean PDI score of 103 (95 percent confidence interval for the difference of the two means, 1.2 to 9.8). The effect was more pronounced when mothers who supplemented breast-feeding with formula were excluded from the analysis. The association persisted even after we controlled for more than 100 potentially confounding variables, including smoking and other drug use during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. We conclude that ethanol ingested through breast milk has a slight but significant detrimental effect on motor development, but not mental development, in breast-fed infants.},

@article{Kaplan1958,
	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤t$_{1}$' ≤t$_{2}$' ≤⋯≤t$_{N}$'. Then <tex-math>{\$}{$\backslash$}hat{\{}P{\}}(t) = {$\backslash$}prod{\_}r {$\backslash$}lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1){$\backslash$}rbrack{\$}</tex-math>, where r assumes those values for which t$_{r}$' ≤t and for which t$_{r}$' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Published epidemiologic research usually provides a quantitative assessment of random error for effect estimates, but no quantitative assessment of systematic error. Sensitivity analysis can provide such an assessment. METHODS: We describe a method to reconstruct epidemiologic data, accounting for biases, and to display the results of repeated reconstructions as an assessment of error. We illustrate with a study of the effect of less-than-definitive therapy on breast cancer mortality. RESULTS: We developed SAS code to reconstruct the data that would have been observed had a set of systematic errors been absent, and to convey the results. After 4,000 reconstructions of the example data, we obtained a median estimate of relative hazard equal to 1.5 with a 95% simulation interval of 0.8-2.8. The relative hazard obtained by conventional analysis equaled 2.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.2-3.4. CONCLUSIONS: Our method of sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify the systematic error for an estimate of effect and to describe that error in figures, tables, or text. In the example, the sources of error biased the conventional relative hazard away from the null, and that error was not accurately communicated by the conventional confidence interval.},

@article{Gbr2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated racial/ethnic disparities in medication non-adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes using common measures such as medication possession ratio (MPR) or gaps between refills. All these measures including MPR are quasi-continuous and bounded and their distribution is usually skewed. Analysis of such measures using traditional regression methods that model mean changes in the dependent variable may fail to provide a full picture about differential patterns in non-adherence between groups. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 11,272 veterans with type 2 diabetes was assembled from Veterans Administration datasets from April 1996 to May 2006. The main outcome measure was MPR with quantile cutoffs Q1-Q4 taking values of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 0.9. Quantile-regression (QReg) was used to model the association between MPR and race/ethnicity after adjusting for covariates. Comparison was made with commonly used ordinary-least-squares (OLS) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). RESULTS: Quantile-regression showed that Non-Hispanic-Black (NHB) had statistically significantly lower MPR compared to Non-Hispanic-White (NHW) holding all other variables constant across all quantiles with estimates and p-values given as -3.4% (p = 0.11), -5.4% (p = 0.01), -3.1% (p = 0.001), and -2.00% (p = 0.001) for Q1 to Q4, respectively. Other racial/ethnic groups had lower adherence than NHW only in the lowest quantile (Q1) of about -6.3% (p = 0.003). In contrast, OLS and GLMM only showed differences in mean MPR between NHB and NHW while the mean MPR difference between other racial groups and NHW was not significant. CONCLUSION: Quantile regression is recommended for analysis of data that are heterogeneous such that the tails and the central location of the conditional distributions vary differently with the covariates. QReg provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between independent and dependent variables (i.e. not just centrally but also in the tails of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable). Indeed, without performing QReg at different quantiles, an investigator would have no way of assessing whether a difference in these relationships might exist.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deaths among preterm births are presumably due to both immaturity and the conditions that cause preterm birth. Their relative contributions are unknown. METHODS: Using US birth certificates (1995-2002), we estimated what portion of preterm neonatal mortality may be attributable to immaturity alone. Twins have elevated mortality, yet they usually have lower mortality than singletons at most preterm weeks. Twinning itself is a cause of early birth. Thus, at any given preterm week, singletons are more likely than twins to have pathologic causes of preterm delivery. If any such cause is associated with a mortality risk higher than that conferred by twinning, it is possible for singletons to have higher mortality than twins at some preterm weeks. Thus, mortality of twins at those weeks comes closer to describing the risk due to immaturity itself. To exclude high-risk babies, we focused on singletons and twins least likely to have suffered fetal growth disruptions (ie, those with "optimal" birth weight). At each gestational week from 24 to 36, we identified (for twins and singletons separately) the 500-gram weight category with the lowest neonatal mortality, and selected the lower of the 2 mortality rates. RESULTS: Using the above as our best estimates of mortality due to immaturity alone, we calculated that about half the mortality of singleton preterm babies was due to the pathologies that cause early delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that cause preterm birth apparently contribute a large proportion of preterm mortality. If so, the prevention of preterm mortality requires more than the postponement of delivery.},

RESULTS: Any age- and sex-specific mean, quartiles, and 95th percentiles of background serum TCDD concentrations of study participants between ages 18 and 85 years can be estimated from the regressions for the UMDES reference population and the NHANES non-Hispanic white population. For example, for a 50-year-old man in the reference population of UMDES, the mean, quartiles, and 95th percentile serum TCDD concentrations are estimated to be 1.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.8, and 3.3 parts per trillion, respectively. The study also shows that the UMDES reference population is a valid reference population for serum TCDD concentrations for other predominantly white populations in Michigan. CONCLUSION: The serum TCDD concentrations increased with age and increased more over age in women than in men, and hence estimation of background concentrations must be adjusted for age and sex. The methods and results discussed in this article have wide application in studies of the concentrations of chemicals in human serum and in environmental samples.},

@article{Liu2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised that education may have greater benefits for persons at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than for those at low risk. METHODS: We estimated the association of education (less than high school, high school, or college graduates) with 10-year CHD risk and body mass index (BMI), using linear and quantile regression models, in the following two nationally representative datasets: the 2006 wave of the Health and Retirement Survey and the 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: Higher educational attainment was associated with lower 10-year CHD risk for all groups. However, the magnitude of this association varied considerably across quantiles for some subgroups. For example, among women in NHANES, a high school degree was associated with 4% (95% confidence interval = -9% to 1%) and 17% (-24% to -8%) lower CHD risk in the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. For BMI, a college degree was associated with uniform decreases across the distribution for women, but with varying increases for men. Compared with those who had not completed high school, male college graduates in the NHANES sample had a BMI that was 6% greater (2% to 11%) at the 10th percentile of the BMI distribution and 7% lower (-10% to -3%) at the 90th percentile (ie, overweight/obese). Estimates from the Health and Retirement Survey sample and the marginal quantile regression models showed similar patterns. CONCLUSION: Conventional regression methods may mask important variations in the associations between education and CHD risk.},

@article{Burgette2011,
	abstract = {Covariates may affect continuous responses differently at various points of the response distribution. For example, some exposure might have minimal impact on conditional means, whereas it might lower conditional 10th percentiles sharply. Such differential effects can be important to detect. In studies of the determinants of birth weight, for instance, it is critical to identify exposures like the one above, since low birth weight is a risk factor for later health problems. Effects of covariates on the tails of distributions can be obscured by models (such as linear regression) that estimate conditional means; however, effects on tails can be detected by quantile regression. We present 2 approaches for exploring high-dimensional predictor spaces to identify important predictors for quantile regression. These are based on the lasso and elastic net penalties. We apply the approaches to a prospective cohort study of adverse birth outcomes that includes a wide array of demographic, medical, psychosocial, and environmental variables. Although tobacco exposure is known to be associated with lower birth weights, the analysis suggests an interesting interaction effect not previously reported: tobacco exposure depresses the 20th and 30th percentiles of birth weight more strongly when mothers have high levels of lead in their blood compared with those who have low blood lead levels.},

@article{Ragland1992,
	abstract = {Dichotomizing a continuous outcome variable casts that variable in traditional epidemiologic terms (that is, disease, no disease). One consequence is overall reduced statistical power. A more fundamental concern is that the magnitude of various measures of association (for example, prevalence ratio, odds ratio) and statistical power depend on the cutpoint used to dichotomize the variable. The phenomenon is illustrated with a hypothetical situation assuming a two-level predictor variable and a normally distributed outcome variable. As the cutpoint is increased from lower to higher values, the prevalence ratio increases steadily, the odds ratio is described by a U-shaped curve, and statistical power is described by an inverted U-shaped curve. Furthermore, the extent of these effects depends on the difference between the means of the continuous outcome variable for the two levels of the predictor variable. An empirical example is given using data on education and blood pressure (dichotomized to create a high blood pressure vs low blood pressure variable). Except at each end of the distribution, the results follow the hypothetical example. The observation has implications for public health and medical treatment; different cutpoints should be examined to determine the optimal cutpoint in terms of policy and/or treatment decisions. The observation described here also has implications for statistical interpretation; statements about the magnitude of association or statistical significance have limited meaning unless both the cutpoint and the distribution of the outcome variable are specified.},

	abstract = {When reporting results from survival analysis, investigators often present crude Kaplan-Meier survival curves and adjusted relative hazards from the Cox proportional hazards model. Occasionally, the investigators will also provide a graphical representation of adjusted survival curves based on regression estimates and the average covariate values in the study groups. In this paper, the authors review the limitations of this approach and examine alternative approaches to obtaining adjusted survival curves that have been proposed. Furthermore, a new method to obtain multivariate adjusted survival curves is described. This method is based on direct adjustment of the observed conditional probability of survival at the time of each event. When an unexposed group is used as a standard for adjusting an exposed group, the survival curve in the exposed group is adjusted to the covariate distribution among the unexposed at the time of the event. This method has the advantage over the average covariate method of allowing for the possibility that the adjusted survival curves differ in shape. The method can handle multiple fixed or time-dependent categorical covariates as well as left truncated data, and it allows for estimation of confidence intervals. The authors have written a macro in SAS language that produces the adjusted survival estimates and graphs. This macro is available on request and can be downloaded through the World Wide Web.},

	abstract = {The lives of many thousands of children born premature or ill at term around the world have been saved by those who work within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Modern-day neonatologists, together with nursing staff and other specialists within this domain, enjoy modern technologies for activities such as financial transactions, online purchasing, music, and video on demand. Yet, when they move into their workspace, in many cases, they are supported by nearly the same technology they used 20 years ago. Medical devices provide visual displays of vital signs through physiological streams such as electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and respiratory rate. Electronic health record initiatives around the world provide an environment for the electronic management of medical records, but they fail to support the high-frequency interpretation of streaming physiological data. We have taken a collaborative research approach to address this need to provide a flexible platform for the real-time online analysis of patients' data streams to detect medically significant conditions that precede the onset of medical complications. The platform supports automated or clinician-driven knowledge discovery to discover new relationships between physiological data stream events and latent medical conditions as well as to refine existing analytics. Patients benefit from the system because earlier detection of signs of the medical conditions may lead to earlier intervention that may potentially lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced length of stays. The clinician benefits from a decision support tool that provides insight into multiple streams of data that are too voluminous to assess with traditional methods. The remainder of this article summarizes the strengths of our research collaboration and the resulting environment known as Artemis, which is currently being piloted within the NICU of The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Interesting new methods from the machine learning literature have been introduced in epidemiologic studies, such as random forest and neural networks.

Here I apply the super learner, an ensembling machine learning approach that combines multiple algorithms into a single algorithm and returns a prediction function with the best cross-validated mean squared error. Super learning is a generalization of stacking methods. I used super learning in the Study of Physical Performance and Age-Related Changes in Sonomans (SPPARCS) to predict death among 2,066 residents of Sonoma, California, aged 54 years or more during the period 1993--1999. The super learner for predicting death (risk score) improved upon all single algorithms in the collection of algorithms, although its performance was similar to that of several algorithms. Super learner outperformed the worst algorithm (neural networks) by 44% with respect to estimated cross-validated mean squared error and had an R2 value of 0.201. The improvement of super learner over random forest with respect to R2 was approximately 2-fold.

	abstract = {One misconception (of many) about Bayesian analyses is that prior distributions introduce assumptions that are more questionable than assumptions made by frequentist methods; yet the assumptions in priors can be more reasonable than the assumptions implicit in standard frequentist models. Another misconception is that Bayesian methods are computationally difficult and require special software. But perfectly adequate Bayesian analyses can be carried out with common software for frequentist analysis. Under a wide range of priors, the accuracy of these approximations is just as good as the frequentist accuracy of the software---and more than adequate for the inaccurate observational studies found in health and social sciences. An easy way to do Bayesian analyses is via inverse-variance (information) weighted averaging of the prior with the frequentist estimate. A more general method expresses the prior distributions in the form of prior data or `data equivalents', which are then entered in the analysis as a new data stratum. That form reveals the strength of the prior judgements being introduced and may lead to tempering of those judgements. It is argued that a criterion for scientific acceptability of a prior distribution is that it be expressible as prior data, so that the strength of prior assumptions can be gauged by how much data they represent.},

@article{Khoury2013,
	abstract = {In 2012, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) engaged the scientific community to provide a vision for cancer epidemiology in the 21st century. Eight overarching thematic recommendations, with proposed corresponding actions for consideration by funding agencies, professional societies, and the research community emerged from the collective intellectual discourse. The themes are (i) extending the reach of epidemiology beyond discovery and etiologic research to include multilevel analysis, intervention evaluation, implementation, and outcomes research; (ii) transforming the practice of epidemiology by moving toward more access and sharing of protocols, data, metadata, and specimens to foster collaboration, to ensure reproducibility and replication, and accelerate translation; (iii) expanding cohort studies to collect exposure, clinical, and other information across the life course and examining multiple health-related endpoints; (iv) developing and validating reliable methods and technologies to quantify exposures and outcomes on a massive scale, and to assess concomitantly the role of multiple factors in complex diseases; (v) integrating "big data" science into the practice of epidemiology; (vi) expanding knowledge integration to drive research, policy, and practice; (vii) transforming training of 21st century epidemiologists to address interdisciplinary and translational research; and (viii) optimizing the use of resources and infrastructure for epidemiologic studies. These recommendations can transform cancer epidemiology and the field of epidemiology, in general, by enhancing transparency, interdisciplinary collaboration, and strategic applications of new technologies. They should lay a strong scientific foundation for accelerated translation of scientific discoveries into individual and population health benefits.},

	abstract = {An overwhelming body of evidence for a protective effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation against neural tube defects (NTDs) led to mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States. The effectiveness of folic acid fortification in improving folate status has already been shown to be quite striking, with a dramatic increase in blood measurements of folate in the United States. Preliminary reports also suggest a significant reduction (≈15--50%) in NTDs in the United States. The success of folic acid fortification in improving folate status and in reducing NTD rates is truly a public health triumph and provides a paradigm of collaboration between science and public health policy. Although folic acid is generally regarded as safe, there continues to be concern that folic acid fortification may have adverse effects in subpopulation groups not originally targeted for fortification. In this regard, an emerging body of evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation may enhance the development and progression of already existing, undiagnosed premalignant and malignant lesions. Over the past few years, the US population has been exposed to a significant increase in folate intake, for which essentially no data on safety exist. The potential cancer-promoting effect of folic acid supplementation needs to be considered in carefully monitoring the long-term effect of folic acid fortification on the vast majority of the US population, who are not at risk of NTDs.},

We apply a joinpoint regression model to describe such continuous changes and use the grid-search method to fit the regression function with unknown joinpoints assuming constant variance and uncorrelated errors. We find the number of significant joinpoints by performing several permutation tests, each of which has a correct significance level asymptotically. Each p-value is found using Monte Carlo methods, and the overall asymptotic significance level is maintained through a Bonferroni correction. These tests are extended to the situation with non-constant variance to handle rates with Poisson variation and possibly autocorrelated errors. The performance of these tests are studied via simulations and the tests are applied to U.S. prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE Full-term neonates born between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age have been considered a homogeneous, low-risk group. However, recent evidence from studies based on mode of delivery has pointed toward increased morbidity associated with early-term cesarean section births (37-38 weeks) compared with term neonates (39-41 weeks). OBJECTIVE To compare the short-term morbidity of early-term vs term neonates in a county-based birth cohort using the primary objective of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or neonatology service. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective population-based 3-year birth cohort study (January 1, 2006-December 31, 2008) at all major birth hospitals in Erie County, New York. All full-term live births comprised the birth cohort; this information was obtained from the hospitals' perinatal databases, and data pertaining to NICU or neonatology service admissions were extracted from individual medical records. EXPOSURE Gestational age of early term (370/7-386/7 weeks) vs term (390/7-410/7 weeks). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Admission to the NICU or neonatology service. RESULTS There were 33 488 live births during the 3-year period, of which 29 741 had a gestational age between 37 and 41 weeks. Of all live births, 9031 (27.0%) were early term. Compared with term infants, early-term neonates had significantly higher risks for the following: hypoglycemia (4.9% vs 2.5%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.92), NICU or neonatology service admission (8.8% vs 5.3%; adjusted OR, 1.64), need for respiratory support (2.0% vs 1.1%; adjusted OR, 1.93), requirement for intravenous fluids (7.5% vs 4.4%; adjusted OR, 1.68), treatment with intravenous antibiotics (2.6% vs 1.6%; adjusted OR, 1.62), and mechanical ventilation or intubation (0.6% vs 0.1%; adjusted OR, 4.57). Delivery by cesarean section was common among early-term births (38.4%) and increased the risk for NICU or neonatology service admission (12.2%) and morbidity (7.5%) compared with term births. Among vaginal deliveries, early-term neonates (6.8%) had a significantly higher rate of NICU or neonatology service admission compared with term neonates (4.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early-term births are associated with high neonatal morbidity and with NICU or neonatology service admission. Evaluation of local prevalence data will assist in implementation of specific preventive measures and plans, as well as prioritize limited health care resources.},

We assume all covariates being considered are pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii) whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the application of the result does not rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, "Is the covariate a cause of the treatment?" and "Is the covariate a cause of the outcome?" If the answer to either question is "yes" then the covariate is included for confounder control. We discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our criterion.},

@article{Pande2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has been controversial. The potential impact of national healthcare reform may be considered using a similar set of state-level reforms including exchanges and a mandate, enacted in 2006 in Massachusetts. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of reforms on healthcare access, affordability, and disparities. DESIGN: Interrupted time series with comparison series. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal survey data from 2002 to 2009 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System including 178,040 nonelderly adults residing in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Analysis was conducted from January to August 2010. INTERVENTION: Massachusetts 2006 healthcare reform, which included an individual health insurance mandate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Being uninsured, having no personal doctor, and forgoing care because of cost, evaluated in Massachusetts and four comparison states before (2002-2005) and after (2007-2009) the healthcare reform. Effects on disparities defined by race, education, income, and employment also were assessed. RESULTS: Living in Massachusetts in 2009 was associated with a 7.6 percentage point (95% CI=3.9, 11.3) higher probability of being insured; 4.8 percentage point (-0.9, 10.6) lower probability of forgoing care because of cost; and a 6.6 percentage point (1.9, 11.3) higher probability of having a personal doctor, compared to expected levels in the absence of reform, defined by trends in control states and adjusting for socioeconomic factors. The effects of the reform on insurance coverage attenuated from 2008 to 2009. In a socioeconomically disadvantaged group, the reforms had a greater effect in improving outcomes on the absolute but not relative scale. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare reforms in Massachusetts, which included a health insurance mandate, were associated with significant increases in insurance coverage and access. The absolute effects of the reform were greater for disadvantaged populations. This is important evidence to consider as debate over national healthcare reform continues.},

METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design, we exploited geographic and time variation in housing prices using third-party valuation estimates of median single-family detached houses from 1988 to 2007 in each of 2400 zip codes combined with Health and Retirement Study data from 1992 to 2006 to test the impact of housing appreciation on physical health outcomes. RESULTS: Respondents living in communities in which home values appreciated more rapidly had fewer functional limitations, performed better on interviewer-administered physical tasks, and had smaller waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that increases in housing wealth were associated with better health outcomes for homeowners in late middle age and older. The recent sharp decline in housing values for this group may likewise be expected to have important implications for health and should be examined as data become available.},

	abstract = {Greening of vacant urban land may affect health and safety. The authors conducted a decade-long difference-in-differences analysis of the impact of a vacant lot greening program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on health and safety outcomes. ``Before'' and ``after'' outcome differences among treated vacant lots were compared with matched groups of control vacant lots that were eligible but did not receive treatment. Control lots from 2 eligibility pools were randomly selected and matched to treated lots at a 3:1 ratio by city section. Random-effects regression models were fitted, along with alternative models and robustness checks. Across 4 sections of Philadelphia, 4,436 vacant lots totaling over 7.8 million square feet (about 725,000 m2) were greened from 1999 to 2008. Regression-adjusted estimates showed that vacant lot greening was associated with consistent reductions in gun assaults across all 4 sections of the city (P < 0.001) and consistent reductions in vandalism in 1 section of the city (P < 0.001). Regression-adjusted estimates also showed that vacant lot greening was associated with residents' reporting less stress and more exercise in select sections of the city (P < 0.01). Once greened, vacant lots may reduce certain crimes and promote some aspects of health. Limitations of the current study are discussed. Community-based trials are warranted to further test these findings.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates models of the evolution of cognitive and noncognitive skills and explores the role of family environments in shaping these skills at different stages of the life cycle of the child. Central to this analysis is identification of the technology of skill formation. We estimate a dynamic factor model to solve the problem of endogeneity of inputs and multiplicity of inputs relative to instruments. We identify the scale of the factors by estimating their effects on adult outcomes. In this fashion we avoid reliance on test scores and changes in test scores that have no natural metric. Parental investments are generally more effective in raising noncognitive skills. Noncognitive skills promote the formation of cognitive skills but, in most specifications of our model, cognitive skills do not promote the formation of noncognitive skills. Parental inputs have different effects at different stages of the child's life cycle with cognitive skills affected more at early ages and noncognitive skills affected more at later ages.},

If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes.

This paper assesses whether this strategy has worked, and what lessons can be learnt. A review of documents was conducted, as well as an analysis of entry-points chosen, specific policies chosen, implementation of these policies, changes in intermediate outcomes, and changes in final health outcomes. Despite some partial successes, the strategy failed to reach its own targets, that is, a 10% reduction in inequalities in life expectancy and infant mortality. This is due to the fact that it did not address the most relevant entry-points, did not use effective policies and was not delivered at a large enough scale for achieving populationwide impacts. Health inequalities can only be reduced substantially if governments have a democratic mandate to make the necessary policy changes, if demonstrably effective policies can be developed, and if these policies are implemented on the scale needed to reach the overall targets.},

	abstract = {The rising rate of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is now one of the most serious public health challenges facing the US. However, the underlying causes for this increase are unclear. This paper examines the effect of family income changes on body mass index (BMI) and obesity using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort. It does so by using exogenous variation in family income in a sample of low-income women and men. This exogenous variation is obtained from the correlation of their family income with the generosity of state and federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program benefits. Income is found to significantly raise the BMI and probability of being obese for women with EITC-eligible earnings, and have no appreciable effect for men with EITC-eligible earnings. The results imply that the increase in real family income from 1990 to 2002 explains between 10 and 21% of the increase in sample women's BMI and between 23 and 29% of their increased obesity prevalence.},

It is unclear how estimates from marginal structural models and conventional models might differ in real settings. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature on marginal structural models since 2000. RESULTS: Data to compare marginal structural models and conventional models were obtained from 65 papers reporting 164 exposure-outcome associations. In 58 (40%), estimates differed by at least 20%, and in 18 (11%), the 2 techniques resulted in estimates with opposite interpretations. In 88 papers, marginal structural models were used to analyze real data; only 53 (60%) papers reported the use of stabilized inverse-probability weights and only 28 (32%) reported that they verified that the mean of the stabilized inverse-probability weights was close to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: We found important differences in results from marginal structural models and from conventional models in real studies. Furthermore, reporting of marginal structural models can be improved.},

Each of these paths contributes to the formation of distinct capacities that social epidemiologists can claim and use to elaborate or fill in gaps in the already strong history of social epidemiology.

	abstract = {Population health improvements are the most relevant yardstick against which to evaluate the success of social epidemiology. In coming years, social epidemiology must increasingly emphasize research that facilitates translation into health improvements, with continued focus on macro-level social determinants of health. Given the evidence that the effects of social interventions often differ across population subgroups, systematic and transparent exploration of the heterogeneity of health determinants across populations will help inform effective interventions. This research should consider both biological and social risk factors and effect modifiers. We also recommend that social epidemiologists take advantage of recent revolutionary improvements in data availability and computing power to examine new hypotheses and expand our repertoire of study designs. Better data and computing power should facilitate underused analytic approaches, such as instrumental variables, simulation studies and models of complex systems, and sensitivity analyses of model biases. Many data-driven machine-learning approaches are also now computationally feasible and likely to improve both prediction models and causal inference in social epidemiology. Finally, we emphasize the importance of specifying exposures corresponding with realistic interventions and policy options. Effect estimates for directly modifiable, clearly defined health determinants are most relevant for building translational social epidemiology to reduce disparities and improve population health.},

	abstract = {A new focus within both social epidemiology and political sociology investigates how political systems and priorities shape health inequities. To advance---and better integrate---research on political determinants of health inequities, the authors conducted a systematic search of the ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed databases and identified 45 studies, commencing in 1992, that explicitly and empirically tested, in relation to an a priori political hypothesis, for either 1) changes in the magnitude of health inequities or 2) significant cross-national differences in the magnitude of health inequities. Overall, 84% of the studies focused on the global North, and all clustered around 4 political factors: 1) the transition to a capitalist economy; 2) neoliberal restructuring; 3) welfare states; and 4) political incorporation of subordinated racial/ethnic, indigenous, and gender groups. The evidence suggested that the first 2 factors probably increase health inequities, the third is inconsistently related, and the fourth helps reduce them. In this review, the authors critically summarize these studies' findings, consider methodological limitations, and propose a research agenda---with careful attention to spatiotemporal scale, level, time frame (e.g., life course, historical generation), choice of health outcomes, inclusion of polities, and specification of political mechanisms---to address the enormous gaps in knowledge that were identified.},

@article{Kaufman1997,
	abstract = {A large number of epidemiologic studies have focused on racial/ethnic differences, particularly between blacks and whites. Because health endpoints and racial categorizations are associated with socioeconomic status, investigators generally adjust for socioeconomic indicators. The intention is usually to control for confounding, thereby making groups comparable and excluding socioeconomic status as an alternative explanation to hypotheses of innate physiologic differences. A threat to the validity of these analyses is therefore the presence of residual confounding. We identify four potential sources of residual confounding in this analytical design: categorization of socioeconomic status variables, measurement error in socioeconomic indicators, use of aggregated socioeconomic status measures, and incommensurate socioeconomic indicators. Using simulations and examples from the literature, we demonstrate that the effect of residual confounding is to bias interpretation of data toward the conclusion of independent racial/ethnic group effects. Investigators often refer to possible "genetic" differences on the basis of models that control for socioeconomic status. We propose that such conclusions on the basis of this analytical strategy are generally unwarranted. Racial/ethnic differences in disease are a pressing public health concern, but the current approach does not often provide a basis for inference about putative biological factors in the etiology of this disparity.},

Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method.},

@article{Howards2007,
	abstract = {Prior pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and preterm birth, are often predictive of future pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, many researchers adjust for reproductive history. Although this adjustment may be appropriate for a predictive model, it is not necessarily appropriate when the goal is to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on disease. Reproductive history may seem to meet the conventional criteria for confounding because it is unlikely to be on the causal pathway between exposure and current outcome, is often associated with current outcome, and may be associated with exposure as well. However, whether reproductive history is a confounder or not depends on the underlying reason for its associations with exposure and current outcome. Thus, conventional methods for assessing confounding are often inadequate. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to evaluate complex scenarios for confounding when the research question is clearly defined with respect to the exposure, the outcome, and the effect estimate of interest. Special care is required when reproductive history affects future exposure. We use 5 DAGs to illustrate possible relations between reproductive history and current outcome. We assess each DAG for confounding, and identify the appropriate analytic technique. We provide a numeric example using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. There is no single answer as to whether reproductive history should be included in the model; the decision depends on the research question and the underlying DAG.},

Notions of direct and indirect effects from a counterfactual approach to mediation are compared with those arising from the standard regression approach to mediation of Baron and Kenny (1986), commonly utilized in the social science literature. It is shown that concepts of direct and indirect effect from causal inference generalize those described by Baron and Kenny and that under appropriate identification assumptions these more general direct and indirect effects from causal inference can be estimated using regression even when there are interactions between the primary exposure of interest and the mediator. A number of conceptual issues are discussed concerning the interpretation of identification conditions for mediation, the notion of counterfactuals based on hypothetical interventions and the so called consistency and composition assumptions.},

	abstract = {Previous investigators have suggested that screening-related biases may explain associations between postmenopausal hormone use and breast cancer. To investigate these biases, we studied postmenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study from 1988 to 1994. Hormone use is associated with increased subsequent screening. Among women not screened in the previous 2 years, the probability difference, comparing current hormone users with others, for having mammography in the following 2 years is 19.5%; among women previously screened, the difference is 4.9%. These differences persist after control for other factors. If the increase in screening is causal, screening by mammogram could be intermediate in the causal pathway to breast cancer diagnosis. To deal with this problem, we restrict attention to a subset of the cohort in which the effect of postmenopausal hormone use on screening is small (women previously screened). In this subset, the rate ratio comparing breast cancer rates among current postmenopausal hormone users with others is 1.28. In a sensitivity analysis, the bias could not by itself plausibly account for the associations in our data. Our data provide evidence of an association between postmenopausal hormone use and breast cancer that is not solely the product of a detection bias.},

	abstract = {Standard statistical analyses of observational data often exclude valuable information from individuals with incomplete measurements. This may lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect and loss of precision. The issue of missing data for inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models (MSMs) has often been addressed, though little has been done to compare different missing data techniques in this relatively new method of analysis. We propose a method for systematically dealing with missingness in MSMs by treating missingness as a cause for censoring and weighting subjects by the inverse probability of missingness. We developed a series of simulations to systematically compare the effect of using case deletion, our inverse weighting approach, and multiple imputation in a MSM when there is missing information on an important confounder. We found that multiple imputation was slightly less biased and considerably less variable than the inverse probability approach. Thus, the lower variability achieved through multiple imputation makes it desirable in most practical cases where the missing data are strongly predicted by the available data.

	annote = {When regression models adjust for mediators on the causal path from exposure to outcome, the regression coefficient of exposure is commonly viewed as a measure of the direct exposure effect. This interpretation can be misleading, even with a randomly assigned exposure. This is because adjustment for post-exposure measurements introduces bias whenever their association with the outcome is confounded by more than just the exposure. By the same token, adjustment for such confounders stays problematic when these are themselves affected by the exposure. Robins accommodated this by introducing linear structural nested direct effect models with direct effect parameters that can be estimated by using inverse probability weighting by a conditional distribution of the mediator. The resulting estimators are consistent, but inefficient, and can be extremely unstable when the mediator is absolutely continuous. We develop direct effect estimators which are not only more efficient but also consistent under a less demanding model for a conditional expectation of the outcome. We find that the one estimator which avoids inverse probability weighting altogether performs best. This estimator is intuitive, computationally straightforward and, as demonstrated by simulation, competes extremely well with ordinary least squares estimators in settings where standard regression is valid.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which women received contraceptive services within 90 days after birth at their first or subsequent visits and whether contraceptive provision was associated with optimal interpregnancy intervals. METHOD: We linked California's 2008 Birth Statistical Master File with Medicaid databases to build a cohort of women aged 15-44 years who had given birth in 2008 and received publicly-funded health care services in the 18 months after their previous live birth (N=117,644). We determined whether provision of contraception within 90 days after birth was associated with optimal interpregnancy intervals when controlling for covariates. RESULT: Only 41% (n=48,775) of women had a contraceptive claim within 90 days after birth. To avoid short interpregnancy intervals, 6 women would need to receive contraception to avoid one additional short interval (number needed to treat=6.38). Receipt of a contraceptive method, receiving contraception at the first clinic visit, and being seen by Medi-Cal and its family planning expansion program were significantly associated with avoidance of short interpregnancy intervals. Receiving contraception at the first postpartum clinic visit had an additional independent effect on avoiding short interpregnancy intervals when controlling for the other variables. Although foreign-born women had 47% higher odds of avoiding short interpregnancy intervals than U.S.-born women, women of Asian and Pacific Islander ethnicity had 24% lower odds of avoiding short interpregnancy intervals than white women. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study suggest that closer attention to provision of postpartum contraception in publicly-funded programs has the potential to improve optimal interpregnancy intervals among low-income women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in perinatal care have increased the number of premature babies who survive. There are concerns, however, about the ability of these children to cope with the demands of adulthood. METHODS: We linked compulsory national registries in Norway to identify children of different gestational-age categories who were born between 1967 and 1983 and to follow them through 2003 in order to document medical disabilities and outcomes reflecting social performance. RESULTS: The study included 903,402 infants who were born alive and without congenital anomalies (1822 born at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation, 2805 at 28 to 30 weeks, 7424 at 31 to 33 weeks, 32,945 at 34 to 36 weeks, and 858,406 at 37 weeks or later). The proportions of infants who survived and were followed to adult life were 17.8%, 57.3%, 85.7%, 94.6%, and 96.5%, respectively. Among the survivors, the prevalence of having cerebral palsy was 0.1% for those born at term versus 9.1% for those born at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation (relative risk for birth at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation, 78.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 56.5 to 110.0); the prevalence of having mental retardation, 0.4% versus 4.4% (relative risk, 10.3; 95% CI, 6.2 to 17.2); and the prevalence of receiving a disability pension, 1.7% versus 10.6% (relative risk, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.5 to 10.0). Among those who did not have medical disabilities, the gestational age at birth was associated with the education level attained, income, receipt of Social Security benefits, and the establishment of a family, but not with rates of unemployment or criminal activity. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of people in Norway who were born between 1967 and 1983, the risks of medical and social disabilities in adulthood increased with decreasing gestational age at birth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although two thirds of infant deaths in the United States occur among infants born preterm (<37 weeks of gestation), only 17% of infant deaths are classified as being attributable to preterm birth with the standard classification of leading causes of death. To address this apparent discrepancy, we sought to estimate more accurately the contribution of preterm birth to infant mortality rates in the United States. METHODS: We identified the top 20 leading causes of infant death in 2002 in the US linked birth/infant death file. The role of preterm birth for each cause was assessed by determining the proportion of infants who were born preterm for each cause of death and by considering the biological connection between preterm birth and the specific cause of death. RESULTS: Of 27970 records in the linked birth/infant death file for 2002, the 20 leading causes accounted for 22273 deaths (80% of all infant deaths). Among infant deaths attributable to the 20 leading causes, we classified 9596 infant deaths (34.3% of all infant deaths) as attributable to preterm birth. Ninety-five percent of those deaths occurred among infants who were born at <32 weeks of gestation and weighed <1500 g, and two thirds of those deaths occurred during the first 24 hours of life. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this evaluation, preterm birth is the most frequent cause of infant death in the United States, accounting for at least one third of infant deaths in 2002. The extreme prematurity of most of the infants and their short survival indicate that reducing infant mortality rates requires a comprehensive agenda to identify, to test, and to implement effective strategies for the prevention of preterm birth.},

METHODS: All women with singleton pregnancies registered at prenatal care centres in Severodvinsk in 1999 comprised the cohort for this study (n=1559). Analysis was based on spontaneous live singleton births at the maternity home (n=1103). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to quantify the effect of the studied factors on the risk of preterm birth. Differences in gestation duration were studied using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: In total, 5.6% of all spontaneous births were preterm. Increased risks of preterm delivery were found in women with lower levels of education and in students. Placental complications, stress and a history of fetal death in previous pregnancies were also associated with elevated risks for preterm delivery. Smoking, hypertension and multigravidity were associated with reduced length of pregnancy in metric form. CONCLUSION: In addition to medical risk factors, social factors are important determinants of preterm birth in transitional Russia. Large disparities in preterm birth rates may reflect the level of inequalities in transitional Russia. Social variations in pregnancy outcomes should be monitored.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the evidence bearing on socio-economic disparities in pregnancy outcome, focusing on aetiological factors mediating the disparities in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm birth. We first summarise what is known about the attributable determinants of IUGR and preterm birth, emphasising their quantitative contributions (aetiological fractions) from a public health perspective. We then review studies relating these determinants to socio-economic status and, combined with the evidence about their aetiological fractions, reach some tentative conclusions about their roles as mediators of the socio-economic disparities. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy appears to be the most important mediating factor for IUGR, with low gestational weight gain and short stature also playing substantial roles. For preterm birth, socio-economic gradients in bacterial vaginosis and cigarette smoking appear to explain some of the socio-economic disparities; psychosocial factors may prove even more important, but their aetiological links with preterm birth require further clarification. Research that identifies and quantifies the causal pathways and mechanisms whereby social disadvantage leads to higher risks of IUGR and preterm birth may eventually help to reduce current disparities and improve pregnancy outcome across the entire socio-economic spectrum.},

@article{Joseph2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health care system in Canada provides essential health services to all women irrespective of socioeconomic status. Our objective was to determine whether perinatal and infant outcomes varied by family income and other socioeconomic factors in this setting. METHODS: We included all 92,914 women who delivered in Nova Scotia between 1988 and 1995 following a singleton pregnancy. Family income was obtained for 76,440 of these women through a confidential link to income tax records and was divided into 5 groups. Outcomes studied included pregnancy complications, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age live birth, perinatal death, serious neonatal morbidity, postneonatal death and infant death. Logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with women in the highest family income group, those in the lowest income group had significantly higher rates of gestational diabetes (crude rate ratio [RR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.73), preterm birth (crude RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), small-for-gestational-age live birth (crude RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.66-1.97) and postneonatal death (crude RR 5.54, 95% CI 2.21-13.9). The opposite was true for rates of perinatal death (crude RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.96), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the composite of perinatal death or serious neonatal morbidity (crude RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82-1.24). Adjustment for behavioural and lifestyle factors accentuated or attenuated socioeconomic differences. INTERPRETATION: Lower family income is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, small-for-gestational-age live birth and postneonatal death despite health care services being widely available at no out-of-pocket expense.},

Here we examine time changes in risks of preterm birth by maternal educational attainment in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Information on gestational age and maternal socio-economic position was obtained from the NorCHASE database, which includes comparable population-based register data of births from Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway from 1981 to 2000. The risks of very preterm birth (<32 gestational weeks) and moderately preterm birth (32-36 gestational weeks) were calculated by maternal educational attainment and analysed in 5-year intervals from 1981 to 2000. Compared with mothers with >12 years of education, mothers with <10 years of education had similarly increased risks of very, and to a lesser extent moderately, preterm birth in all four countries. The educational gradient increased slightly over time in very preterm births in Denmark, while there was a slight narrowing of the gap in Sweden. In moderately preterm births, the educational inequality gap was constant over the study period in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but narrowed in Finland. The educational gradient in preterm birth remained broadly stable from 1981 to 2000 in all four countries. Consequently, the socio-economic inequalities in preterm birth were not strongly influenced by structural changes during the period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic position is generally associated with increased risk of preterm birth, but it remains unclear whether the inequality depends on the socioeconomic measure used, if the associations differ according to the degree of prematurity, and how individual level risk factors mediate the association. METHODS: The hazard ratios (HR) of preterm birth associated with five different measures of socioeconomic position and three degrees of preterm birth were analysed in a dataset of 75 890 singleton pregnancies (1996-2002) from the Danish National Birth Cohort. This, and the mediating role of selected individual level risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, binge drinking, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain) were estimated, using Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Mothers with <10 years of education had an elevated risk of preterm birth compared with mothers with >12 years of education and the association interacted with parity, while income and occupation affected the risk to a lesser degree. The adjusted HR for less educated nulliparous and parous women were 1.22 (95% CI 1.04-1.42) and 1.56 (95% CI 1.31-1.87), respectively, compared with women with >12 years of education. For parous women with <10 years of education inclusion of smoking in the model decreased the HR of preterm birth to 1.43 (95% CI 1.19-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal educational level was the strongest predictor of preterm birth among five socioeconomic measures and the gradient did not differ significantly according to the degree of preterm birth. For parous women smoking explained some of the educational gradient but in general the selected risk factors only reduced the relative educational gradient in preterm birth marginally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a low socioeconomic status has consistently been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, little is known about the pathways through which socioeconomic disadvantage influences preterm birth. AIM: To examine mechanisms that might underlie the association between the educational level of pregnant women as an indicator of socioeconomic status, and preterm birth. METHODS: The study was nested in a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands. Information was available for 3830 pregnant women of Dutch origin. FINDINGS: The lowest-educated pregnant women had a statistically significant higher risk of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR) = 1.89 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.80)) than the highest educated women. This increased OR was reduced by up to 22% after separate adjustment for age, height, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, financial concerns, long-lasting difficulties, psychopathology, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI) of the pregnant women. Joint adjustment for these variables resulted in a reduction of 89% of the increased risk of preterm birth among low-educated pregnant women (fully adjusted OR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.84)). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with a low educational level have a nearly twofold higher risk of preterm birth than women with a high educational level. This elevated risk could largely be explained by pregnancy characteristics, indicators of psychosocial well-being, and lifestyle habits. Apparently, educational inequalities in preterm birth go together with an accumulation of multiple adverse circumstances among women with a low education. A number of explanatory mechanisms unravelled in the present study seem to be modifiable by intervention programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used to controlling menopausal symptoms and prevent adverse cardiovascular events. However, the benefit and risk of HRT on cardiovascular outcomes remains controversial. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically searched the PubMed, EmBase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for obtaining relevant literature. All eligible trials reported on the effects of HRT on cardiovascular outcomes. We did a random effects meta-analysis to obtain summary effect estimates for the clinical outcomes with use of relative risks calculated from the raw data of included trials. Of 1903 identified studies, we included 10 trials reporting data on 38908 postmenopausal women. Overall, we noted that estrogen combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy as compared to placebo had no effect on coronary events (RR, 1.07; 95%CI: 0.91-1.26; P = 0.41), myocardial infarction (RR, 1.09; 95%CI: 0.85-1.41; P = 0.48), stroke (RR, 1.21; 95%CI: 1.00-1.46; P = 0.06), cardiac death (RR, 1.19; 95%CI: 0.91-1.56; P = 0.21), total death (RR, 1.06; 95%CI: 0.81-1.39; P = 0.66), and revascularization (RR, 0.95; 95%CI: 0.83-1.08; P = 0.43). In addition, estrogen therapy alone had no effect on coronary events (RR, 0.93; 95%CI: 0.80-1.08; P = 0.33), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.95; 95%CI: 0.78-1.15; P = 0.57), cardiac death (RR, 0.86; 95%CI: 0.65-1.13; P = 0.27), total mortality (RR, 1.02; 95%CI: 0.89-1.18; P = 0.73), and revascularization (RR, 0.77; 95%CI: 0.45-1.31; P = 0.34), but associated with a 27% increased risk for incident stroke (RR, 1.27; 95%CI: 1.06-1.53; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Hormone replacement therapy does not effect on the incidence of coronary events, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, total mortality or revascularization. However, it might contributed an important role on the risk of incident stroke.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To critically review the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for asymptomatic postmenopausal women who are considering long-term hormone therapy to prevent disease or to prolong life. DATA SOURCES: Review of the English-language literature since 1970 on the effect of estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy on endometrial cancer, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, and stroke. We used standard meta-analytic statistical methods to pool estimates from studies to determine summary relative risks for these diseases in hormone users and modified lifetable methods to estimate changes in lifetime probability and life expectancy due to use of hormone regimens. RESULTS: There is evidence that estrogen therapy decreases risk for coronary heart disease and for hip fracture, but long-term estrogen therapy increases risk for endometrial cancer and may be associated with a small increase in risk for breast cancer. The increase in endometrial cancer risk can probably be avoided by adding a progestin to the estrogen regimen for women who have a uterus, but the effects of combination hormones on risk for other diseases has not been adequately studied. We present estimates for changes in lifetime probabilities of disease and life expectancy due to hormone therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy; with coronary heart disease; and at increased risk for coronary heart disease, hip fracture, and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy should probably be recommended for women who have had a hysterectomy and for those with coronary heart disease or at high risk for coronary heart disease. For other women, the best course of action is unclear.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-infected individuals is limited. Most clinical trials examined surrogate endpoints over short periods of follow-up and there has been no placebo-controlled randomised trial of HAART. Estimation of treatment effects in observational studies is problematic, because of confounding by indication. We aimed to use novel methodology to overcome this problem in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. METHODS: Patients were included if they had been examined after January 1996, when HAART became available in Switzerland, were not on HAART, and were free of AIDS at baseline. Cox regression models were weighted to create a statistical population in which the probability of being treated at each time point was unrelated to prognostic factors. RESULTS: Low CD4 counts and increasing HIV-1 viral load were associated with increased probability of starting HAART. Overall hazard ratios were 0.14 (95% CI 0.07-0.29) for HAART compared with no treatment, and 0.49 (0.31-0.79) compared with dual therapy. Compared with no treatment, HAART became more beneficial with increasing time since initiation but was less beneficial for patients whose presumed mode of transmission was via intravenous drug use (hazard ratio 0.27, 0.12-0.61) than for other patients (0.08, 0.03-0.19). INTERPRETATION: Our results, which are appropriately controlled for confounding by indication, are consistent with reported declines in rates of AIDS and death in developed countries, and provide a context in which to consider adverse effects of HAART.},

	abstract = {Epidemiology is the study of the causes and distributions of diseases in human populations so that we may identify ways to prevent and control disease. Although this definition broadly serves us well, I suggest that in recent decades, our discipline's robust interest in identifying causes has come at the expense of a more rigorous engagement with the second part of our vision for ourselves---the intent for us to intervene---and that this approach threatens to diminish our field's relevance. I argue here for a consequentialist epidemiology, a formalization and recalibration of the philosophical foundations of our discipline. I discuss how epidemiology is, at its core, more comfortably a consequentialist, as opposed to a deontological, discipline. A more consequentialist approach to epidemiology has several implications. It clarifies our research priorities, offers a perspective on the place of novel epidemiologic approaches and a metric to evaluate the utility of new methods, elevates the importance of global health and considerations about equity to the discipline, brings into sharp focus our engagement in implementation and translational science, and has implications for how we teach our students. I intend this article to be a provocation that can help clarify our disciplinary intentions.},

Motivated by calls for epidemiologic research to be presented in ways that are more informative for intervention, the authors present a didactic discussion of the steps required to estimate the population effect of a potential intervention using an imputation-based causal inference method and discuss the assumptions of and limitations to its use. An analysis of neighborhood smoking norms and individual smoking behavior is used as an illustration. The implementation steps include the following: 1) modeling the adjusted exposure and outcome association, 2) imputing the outcome probability for each individual while manipulating the exposure by "setting" it to different values, 3) averaging these probabilities across the population, and 4) bootstrapping confidence intervals. Imputed probabilities represent counterfactual estimates of the population smoking prevalence if neighborhood smoking norms could be manipulated through intervention. The degree to which temporal ordering, randomization, stability, and experimental treatment assignment assumptions are met in the illustrative example is discussed, along with ways that future studies could be designed to better meet the assumptions. With this approach, the potential effects of an intervention targeting neighborhoods, individuals, or other units can be estimated.},

@article{Cousens2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In non-randomised evaluations of public-health interventions, statistical methods to control confounding will usually be required. We review approaches to the control of confounding and discuss issues in drawing causal inference from these studies. METHODS: Non-systematic review of literature and mathematical data-simulation. RESULTS: Standard stratification and regression techniques will often be appropriate, but propensity scores may be useful where many confounders need to be controlled, and data are limited. All these techniques require that key putative confounders are measured accurately. Instrumental variables offer, in theory, a solution to the problem of unknown or unmeasured confounders, but identifying an instrument which meets the required conditions will often be challenging. Obtaining measurements of the outcome variable in both intervention and control groups before the intervention is introduced allows balance to be assessed, and these data may be used to help control confounding. However, imbalance in outcome measures at baseline poses challenges for the analysis and interpretation of the evaluation, highlighting the value of adopting a design strategy that maximises the likelihood of achieving balance. Finally, when it is not possible to have any concurrent control group, making multiple measures of outcome pre- and postintervention can enable the estimation of intervention effects with appropriate statistical models. CONCLUSION: For non-randomised designs, careful statistical analysis can help reduce bias by confounding in estimating intervention effects. However, investigators must report their methods thoroughly and be conscious and critical of the assumptions they must make whenever they adopt these designs.},

We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

They also provide concisely stated lists of assumptions necessary for estimation of these effects, including various conditional independencies and homogeneity of exposure and mediator effects over covariate strata. They further suggest that this will allow effect decomposition in case-control studies if the sampling fractions and population outcome prevalence are known with certainty. In this invited commentary, the author argues that, in a well-designed case-control study in which the sampling fraction is known, it should not be necessary to rely on the odds ratio. The odds ratio has well-known deficiencies as a causal parameter, and its use severely complicates evaluation of confounding and effect homogeneity. Although VanderWeele and Vansteelandt propose that a rare disease assumption is not necessary for estimation of controlled direct effects using their approach, collapsibility concerns suggest otherwise when the goal is causal inference rather than merely measuring association. Moreover, their clear statement of assumptions necessary for the estimation of natural/pure effects suggests that these quantities will rarely be viable estimands in observational epidemiology.},

@article{Kaufman1999,
	abstract = {Social factors are associated with a wide variety of health outcomes. Social epidemiology has successfully used the traditional methods of surveillance and description to establish consistent relations between social factors and health status. Epidemiology as an etiologic science, however, has been largely ineffective in moving toward causal explanations for these observed patterns. Using the counterfactual approach to causal inference, the authors describe several fundamental problems that often arise when researchers seek to infer explanatory mechanisms from data on social factors. Contrasts that form standard causal effect estimates require implicit unobserved (counterfactual) quantities, because observational data provide only one exposure state for each individual. Although application of counterfactual arguments has successfully advanced etiologic understanding in other observational settings, the particular nature of social factors often leads to logical contradictions or misleading inferences when investigators fail to clearly articulate the counterfactual contrasts that are implied. For example, because social factors are often attributes of individuals and are components of structured social relations, random assignment is not plausible even as a hypothetical experiment, making typical epidemiologic contrasts inappropriate and the inference equivocal at best. Accordingly, more deliberate and creative approaches to causal inference in social epidemiology are required. Infectious disease epidemiology and systems analysis provide examples of approaches to causal inference that can be used when statistical mimicry of simple experimental designs is not tenable. In an era of increasing social inequality, valid approaches for the study of social factors and health are needed more urgently than ever. Am J Epidemiol 1999;150:113--20.},

	abstract = {A randomized trial had suggested that high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) might increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in predialysis diabetic patients. To evaluate this risk in diabetic patients receiving dialysis, we used data from 35,593 elderly Medicare patients on hemodialysis in the US Renal Data System of whom 19,034 were diabetic. A pooled logistic model was used to estimate the monthly probability of mortality and a composite cardiovascular end point. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for measured time-dependent confounding by indication, estimated separately for diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts. The adjusted 9-month mortality risk, significantly different between an ESA dose of 45,000 and 15,000 U/week, was 13% among diabetics and 5% among non-diabetics. In diabetic patients, the hazard ratio (HR) for more than 40,000 U/week was 1.32 for all-cause mortality and 1.26 for a composite end point of death and cardiovascular events compared with patients receiving 20,000 to 30,000 U/week. The corresponding HRs in non-diabetic patients were 1.06 and 1.10, respectively. A smaller effect of dose was found in non-diabetic patients. Thus, higher ESA doses, which are often necessary to achieve high hemoglobin levels, are not beneficial, and possibly harmful, to diabetic patients receiving dialysis. Our findings support a Food and Drug Administration advisory recommending that the lowest possible ESA dose be used to treat hemodialysis patients.},

	abstract = {The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis provides a valid test of the null hypothesis and naturally results in both absolute and relative measures of risk. However, this analytic approach may miss the occurrence of serious adverse effects that would have been detected under full adherence to the assigned treatment. Inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models has been used to adjust for nonadherence, but most studies have provided only relative measures of risk. In this study, we used inverse probability weighting to estimate both absolute and relative measures of risk of invasive breast cancer under full adherence to the assigned treatment in the Women's Health Initiative estrogen-plus-progestin trial. In contrast to an ITT hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 1.54), the HR for 8-year continuous estrogen-plus-progestin use versus no use was 1.68 (1.24 to 2.28). The estimated risk difference (cases/100 women) at year 8 was 0.83 (-0.03 to 1.69) in the ITT analysis, compared with 1.44 (0.52 to 2.37) in the adherence-adjusted analysis. Results were robust across various dose-response models. We also compared the dynamic treatment regimen "take hormone therapy until certain adverse events become apparent, then stop taking hormone therapy" with no use (HR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.18). The methods described here are also applicable to observational studies with time-varying treatments.},

@article{King2003,
	abstract = {An adequate supply of nutrients is probably the single most important environmental factor affecting pregnancy outcome. Women with early or closely spaced pregnancies are at increased risk of entering a reproductive cycle with reduced reserves. Maternal nutrient depletion may contribute to the increased incidence of preterm births and fetal growth retardation among these women as well as the increased risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. In the past, it was assumed that the fetus functioned as a parasite and withdrew its nutritional needs from maternal tissues. Studies in both animals and humans demonstrate, however, that if the maternal nutrient supply is inadequate, the delicate balance between maternal and fetal needs is disturbed and a state of biological competition exists. Furthermore, maternal nutritional status at conception influences how nutrients are partitioned between the mother and fetal dyad. In severe deficiencies maternal nutrition is given preference; in a marginal state the fetal compartment is favored. Although the studies of nutrient partitioning have focused on energy and protein, the partitioning of micronutrients may also be influenced by the maternal nutritional status. Marginal intakes of iron and folic acid during the reproductive period induce a poor maternal status for these nutrients during the interpregnancy interval. Poor iron and folic acid status has also been linked to preterm births and fetal growth retardation. Supplementation with food and micronutrients during the interpregnancy period may improve pregnancy outcomes and maternal health among women with early or closely spaced pregnancies.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal folate depletion has been proposed as a primary explanation for the excess risk of fetal growth restriction associated with short interpregnancy intervals.Objective: We aimed to evaluate the folate depletion hypothesis in a community-based cohort of pregnant women.Design: Using a subsample of the cohort (multiparous participants who delivered a liveborn singleton infant, n = 3153), we investigated the relation between an increase in the interpregnancy interval (from 1 to 24 mo, natural log transformation) and birth weight and the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) in 3 strata of maternal periconceptional folic acid use: nonuse, late use (begun after conception), and early use (begun before conception).Results: Each increase in the interpregnancy interval on the natural log (ln) scale was associated with a mean ($\pm$SE) increase of 63.1 $\pm$ 20.3 g in birth weight (P = 0.002). This relation was mitigated by folic acid use: the change in birth weight was increases of 165.2 $\pm$ 39.6 g for nonuse (P < 0.001) and 33.5 $\pm$ 35.6 g for late use (P = 0.347) and a decrease of 5.9 $\pm$ 33.6 g for early use (P = 0.861). The birth weight differences were directly translated into SGA risk. Odds ratios per 1-mo increase in ln(interpregnancy interval) were significant for the total group (0.61; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.82) and for nonuse (0.38; 0.24, 0.60) and nonsignificant for late (0.83; 0.48, 1.44) and early (1.28; 0.58, 2.84) use.Conclusions: Folate depletion apparently contributes to the excess risk of fetal growth restriction that is associated with short interpregnancy intervals. As a preventive option, postnatal supplementation may be beneficial, but confirmation is needed.},

@article{Petersen2006,
	abstract = {Many common problems in epidemiologic and clinical research involve estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome while blocking the exposure's effect on an intermediate variable. Effects of this kind are termed direct effects. Estimation of direct effects is typically the goal of research aimed at understanding mechanistic pathways by which an exposure acts to cause or prevent disease, as well as in many other settings. Although multivariable regression is commonly used to estimate direct effects, this approach requires assumptions beyond those required for the estimation of total causal effects. In addition, when the exposure and intermediate variables interact to cause disease, multivariable regression estimates a particular type of direct effect-the effect of an exposure on an outcome when the intermediate is fixed at a specified level. Using the counterfactual framework, we distinguish this definition of a direct effect (controlled direct effect) from an alternative definition, in which the effect of the exposure on the intermediate is blocked, but the intermediate is otherwise allowed to vary as it would in the absence of exposure (natural direct effect). We illustrate the difference between controlled and natural direct effects using several examples. We present an estimation approach for natural direct effects that can be implemented using standard statistical software, and we review the assumptions underlying our approach (which are less restrictive than those proposed by previous authors).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite the recent increase in preterm birth in the United States, trends in preterm birth subtypes have not been adequately examined. We examined trends in preterm birth among singletons following ruptured membranes, medical indications, and spontaneous preterm birth and evaluated the impact of these trends on perinatal mortality. METHODS: A population-based, retrospective cohort study comprising 46,375,578 women (16% blacks) who delivered singleton births in the United States, 1989 through 2000, was performed. Rates of preterm birth (< 37 weeks), their subtypes, and associated perinatal mortality (stillbirths at >/= 22 weeks plus neonatal deaths within 28 days), before and after adjustment for potential confounders, were derived from ecological logistic regression models. RESULTS: Preterm birth rates increased by 14% (95% confidence interval 13-15%) among whites from 8.3% to 9.4% and decreased by 15% (95% confidence interval 14-16%) among blacks from 18.5% to 16.2% between 1989 and 2000. Among whites, preterm birth following ruptured membranes declined by 23%, medically indicated preterm birth increased by 55%, and spontaneous preterm birth increased by 3%. Among blacks, preterm birth following ruptured membranes declined by 37%, medically indicated preterm birth increased by 32%, and spontaneous preterm birth decreased by 27%. The largest decline in perinatal mortality among whites was associated with increases in medically indicated preterm birth, whereas the largest decline in perinatal mortality among blacks was associated with declines in preterm birth following ruptured membranes and spontaneous preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Temporal trends in preterm birth varied substantially based on underlying subtype and maternal race. The recent increase in medically indicated preterm birth was associated with a favorable reduction in perinatal mortality.},

@article{Sibai2006,
	abstract = {Gestational hypertension-preeclampsia is the most common medical disorder of pregnancy. It is also a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidities. The majority of adverse pregnancy outcomes occur in patients who develop severe hypertension or severe preeclampsia, and in those who develop the clinical manifestations before 34 weeks' gestation. There is some concern regarding neonatal morbidity in the late preterm (near term) infant (34 0/7 through 36 6/7 weeks' gestation) as a result of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. A review of the available data suggests that most deliveries of the late preterm infant in such women are justified because of the concerns about maternal and fetal safety with continued gestation. In addition, the rate of preterm delivery at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation in women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia is low. Indeed, most admissions to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in such pregnancies occur in those at > or =37 weeks' gestation. There is urgent need for research to assess the reasons behind preterm delivery at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation in women with hypertension and preeclampsia. In addition, there is need for research to assess the reasons for admission to the NICU in term infants born of mothers with varying severities of hypertension and preeclampsia. In this paper, the phrase "late-preterm" has been used instead of "near term," as the former was considered more appropriate to reflect this subgroup of preterm infants in a workshop on this topic held in July 2005, organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.},

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of preterm birth, which is strongly associated with cerebral palsy (CP). However, there is controversy about whether pre-eclampsia is associated with increased risk of CP. We evaluated the association between pre-eclampsia and CP in 122,476 mother-child pairs insured by the South Carolina Medicaid programme, with births between 1996 and 2002. Prenatal billing records were linked to the children's Medicaid billing records after birth until December 2008. The odds of CP were modelled using logistic regression with generalised estimating equations. There were 337 children (0.28%) diagnosed with CP by at least two different health care providers, and 4226 (3.5%) women were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia at least twice during pregnancy. Children whose mothers had pre-eclampsia were almost twice as likely to have CP compared with children of mothers without pre-eclampsia [odds ratio (OR)=1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25, 2.97]. The association was only significant for pre-eclampsia diagnosed prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Full term (gestational age >/= 37 weeks) infants whose mothers were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia prior to 37 weeks had increased odds of CP compared with full term children whose mothers did not have pre-eclampsia (OR=3.41, 95% CI 1.40, 8.31). Preterm infants whose mothers had pre-eclampsia were at significantly increased risk of CP compared with full term infants whose mothers did not have pre-eclampsia (OR=5.88, 95% CI 3.40, 10.17). The greatest risk for CP was in preterm infants whose mothers did not have pre-eclampsia (OR=8.12, 95% CI 6.49, 10.17 compared with full term infants without exposure to pre-eclampsia). We conclude that pre-eclampsia with onset before 37 weeks' gestation is a significant risk factor for CP. Some of the association is probably attributable to high risk of preterm birth because of early pre-eclampsia, while a 'direct' effect of pre-eclampsia on fetal brain development also seems likely.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between maternal pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (PE) and childhood epilepsy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked maternal-child billing data for Medicaid births in South Carolina from 1996 through 2002, with follow-up billing data for children through December 2008. Women with PE (exposed) and children with epilepsy (outcome) were identified using ICD-9 codes. Non-singleton births, children with documented conditions known to cause abnormal brain development, and children who neither remained in Medicaid until age 6 nor were diagnosed with epilepsy were excluded. RESULTS: Of 95,450 mother-child pairs in the final cohort, 5460 mothers were diagnosed with PE (5.7%) and 1106 children had the outcome of epilepsy (1.2%). After controlling for potential confounders, PE was significantly associated with risk of epilepsy (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.17-1.82). The increased risk of epilepsy was observed only among full-term infants, and for this subgroup, late PE (first diagnosed after 37 weeks of gestation) was significantly associated with epilepsy (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.21-2.16). The association between PE and epilepsy was particularly strong for children with focal epilepsy. CONCLUSION: Pre-eclampsia is associated with childhood epilepsy. Additional research is needed to identify potential mechanisms for the association.},

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. It is a pregnancy-specific disease characterised by de-novo development of concurrent hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes progressing into a multiorgan cluster of varying clinical features. Poor early placentation is especially associated with early onset disease. Predisposing cardiovascular or metabolic risks for endothelial dysfunction, as part of an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, might dominate in the origins of late onset pre-eclampsia. Because the multifactorial pathogenesis of different pre-eclampsia phenotypes has not been fully elucidated, prevention and prediction are still not possible, and symptomatic clinical management should be mainly directed to prevent maternal morbidity (eg, eclampsia) and mortality. Expectant management of women with early onset disease to improve perinatal outcome should not preclude timely delivery-the only definitive cure. Pre-eclampsia foretells raised rates of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in later life, which could be reason for subsequent lifestyle education and intervention.},

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality (15-20{\%} in developed countries) and morbidities (acute and long-term), perinatal deaths, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Key findings support a causal or pathogenetic model of superficial placentation driven by immune maladaptation, with subsequently reduced concentrations of angiogenic growth factors and increased placental debris in the maternal circulation resulting in a (mainly hypertensive) maternal inflammatory response. The final phenotype, maternal pre-eclamptic syndrome, is further modulated by pre-existing maternal cardiovascular or metabolic fitness. Currently, women at risk are identified on the basis of epidemiological and clinical risk factors, but the diagnostic criteria of pre-eclampsia remain unclear, with no known biomarkers. Treatment is still prenatal care, timely diagnosis, proper management, and timely delivery. Many interventions to lengthen pregnancy (eg, treatment for mild hypertension, plasma-volume expansion, and corticosteroid use) have a poor evidence base. We review findings on the diagnosis, risk factors, and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and the present status of its prediction, prevention, and management.},

The objective of this review is to evaluate the maternal characteristics, pregnancy complications and birth outcomes including congenital abnormalities of pregnant women with chronic hypertension by reviewing the results of published studies and mainly the data of the population-based data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Abnormalities. A second aim of the review is to examine the efficacy of antihypertensive drug treatments in the reduction of pregnancy-associated risks in women with chronic hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: Pregnant women with treated chronic hypertension had a higher risk - beyond the well known pre-eclampsia and low birthweight newborns - of threatened abortion and preterm delivery, placental disorders and gestational diabetes. In addition a higher risk of hypospadias in one and of esophageal atresia/stenosis in another study was found in the children of pregnant women with chronic hypertension. These latter findings are signals which need confirmation or rejection in other studies. SUMMARY: The present antihypertensive treatments do not neutralize the harm of severe chronic hypertension in pregnant women and in their offspring, thus it is necessary to introduce more effective drug combinations for the treatment of pregnant women with severe chronic hypertension.},

The standard approach, logistic regression adjusting for both exposure and the mediator, is known to be biased in the presence of confounders for the mediator-outcome relationship. Because additional regression adjustment for such confounders is only justified when they are not affected by the exposure, inverse probability weighting has been advocated, but is not ideally tailored to mediators that are continuous or have strong measured predictors. We overcome this limitation by developing inference for a novel class of causal models that are closely related to Robins' logistic structural direct effect models, but do not inherit their difficulties of estimation. We study identification and efficient estimation under the assumption that all confounders for the exposure-outcome and mediator-outcome relationships have been measured, and find adequate performance in simulation studies.

A causal framework has recently been proposed for mediation analysis, which gives rise to new definitions, formal identification results and novel estimators of direct and indirect effects. In the present paper, the author describes a new inverse odds ratio-weighted approach to estimate so-called natural direct and indirect effects. The approach, which uses as a weight the inverse of an estimate of the odds ratio function relating the exposure and the mediator, is universal in that it can be used to decompose total effects in a number of regression models commonly used in practice. Specifically, the approach may be used for effect decomposition in generalized linear models with a nonlinear link function, and in a number of other commonly used models such as the Cox proportional hazards regression for a survival outcome. The approach is simple and can be implemented in standard software provided a weight can be specified for each observation. An additional advantage of the method is that it easily incorporates multiple mediators of a categorical, discrete or continuous nature. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Wang2013,
	abstract = {Mediators are intermediate variables in the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome. Mediation analysis investigates the extent to which exposure effects occur through these variables, thus revealing causal mechanisms. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the mediation effect when the outcome is binary and multiple mediators of different types exist. We give a precise definition of the total mediation effect as well as decomposed mediation effects through individual or sets of mediators using the potential outcomes framework. We formulate a model of joint distribution (probit-normal) using continuous latent variables for any binary mediators to account for correlations among multiple mediators. A mediation formula approach is proposed to estimate the total mediation effect and decomposed mediation effects based on this parametric model. Estimation of mediation effects through individual or subsets of mediators requires an assumption involving the joint distribution of multiple counterfactuals. We conduct a simulation study that demonstrates low bias of mediation effect estimators for two-mediator models with various combinations of mediator types. The results also show that the power to detect a nonzero total mediation effect increases as the correlation coefficient between two mediators increases, whereas power for individual mediation effects reaches a maximum when the mediators are uncorrelated. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a retrospective cohort study of dental caries in adolescents with low and high socioeconomic status. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of conclusions regarding mediation effects when the assumption of no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders is violated.

This three-way decomposition applies to difference scales and also to additive ratio scales and additive hazard scales. Assumptions needed for the identification of each of these three effects are discussed and simple formulae are given for each when regression models allowing for interaction are used.

	abstract = {Recently, researchers have used a potential-outcome framework to estimate causally interpretable direct and indirect effects of an intervention or exposure on an outcome. One approach to causal-mediation analysis uses the so-called mediation formula to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects. This approach generalizes the classical mediation estimators and allows for arbitrary distributions for the outcome variable and mediator. A limitation of the standard (parametric) mediation formula approach is that it requires a specified mediator regression model and distribution; such a model may be difficult to construct and may not be of primary interest. To address this limitation, we propose a new method for causal-mediation analysis that uses the empirical distribution function, thereby avoiding parametric distribution assumptions for the mediator. To adjust for confounders of the exposure-mediator and exposure-outcome relationships, inverse-probability weighting is incorporated based on a supplementary model of the probability of exposure. This method, which yields the estimates of the natural direct and indirect effects for a specified reference group, is applied to data from a cohort study of dental caries in very-low-birth-weight adolescents to investigate the oral-hygiene index as a possible mediator. Simulation studies show low bias in the estimation of direct and indirect effects in a variety of distribution scenarios, whereas the standard mediation formula approach can be considerably biased when the distribution of the mediator is incorrectly specified.},

	abstract = {An important problem within both epidemiology and many social sciences is to break down the effect of a given treatment into different causal pathways and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Formal mediation analysis based on counterfactuals is a key tool when addressing this problem. During the last decade, the theoretical framework for mediation analysis has been greatly extended to enable the use of arbitrary statistical models for outcome and mediator. However, the researcher attempting to use these techniques in practice will often find implementation a daunting task, as it tends to require special statistical programming. In this paper, the authors introduce a simple procedure based on marginal structural models that directly parameterize the natural direct and indirect effects of interest. It tends to produce more parsimonious results than current techniques, greatly simplifies testing for the presence of a direct or an indirect effect, and has the advantage that it can be conducted in standard software. However, its simplicity comes at the price of relying on correct specification of models for the distribution of mediator (and exposure) and accepting some loss of precision compared with more complex methods.

However, these definitions presuppose well-defined hypothetical interventions on the mediator. In many settings, there may be multiple ways to fix the mediator to a particular value, and these various hypothetical interventions may have very different implications for the outcome of interest. In this paper, we consider mediation analysis when multiple versions of the mediator are present. Specifically, we consider the problem of attempting to decompose a total effect of an exposure on an outcome into the portion through the intermediate and the portion through other pathways. We consider the setting in which there are multiple versions of the mediator but the investigator has access only to data on the particular measurement, not information on which version of the mediator may have brought that value about. We show that the quantity that is estimated as a natural indirect effect using only the available data does indeed have an interpretation as a particular type of mediated effect; however, the quantity estimated as a natural direct effect, in fact, captures both a true direct effect and an effect of the exposure on the outcome mediated through the effect of the version of the mediator that is not captured by the mediator measurement. The results are illustrated using 2 examples from the literature, one in which the versions of the mediator are unknown and another in which the mediator itself has been dichotomized.},

Mediation analysis based on counterfactuals is an important tool when addressing such questions. However, none of the existing techniques for formal mediation analysis can be applied to survival data. This is a severe shortcoming, as many epidemiologic questions can be addressed only with censored survival data. A solution has been to use a number of Cox models (with and without the potential mediator), but this approach does not allow a causal interpretation and is not mathematically consistent. In this paper, we propose a simple measure of mediation in a survival setting. The measure is based on counterfactuals, and measures the natural direct and indirect effects. The method allows a causal interpretation of the mediated effect (in terms of additional cases per unit of time) and is mathematically consistent. The technique is illustrated by analyzing socioeconomic status, work environment, and long-term sickness absence.

	abstract = {The goal of mediation analysis is to assess direct and indirect effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome. More generally, we may be interested in the context of a causal model as characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where mediation via a specific path from exposure to outcome may involve an arbitrary number of links (or "stages"). Methods for estimating mediation (or pathway) effects are available for a continuous outcome and a continuous mediator related via a linear model, while for a categorical outcome or categorical mediator, methods are usually limited to two-stage mediation. We present a method applicable to multiple stages of mediation and mixed variable types using generalized linear models. We define pathway effects using a potential outcomes framework and present a general formula that provides the effect of exposure through any specified pathway. Some pathway effects are nonidentifiable and their estimation requires an assumption regarding the correlation between counterfactuals. We provide a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption. Confidence intervals for pathway effect estimates are obtained via a bootstrap method. The method is applied to a cohort study of dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. A simulation study demonstrates low bias of pathway effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage rates of confidence intervals. We also find low sensitivity to the counterfactual correlation in most scenarios.},

	abstract = {We describe causal mediation methods for analysing the mechanistic factors through which interventions act on outcomes. A number of different mediation approaches have been presented in the biomedical, social science and statistical literature with an emphasis on different aspects of mediation. We review the different sets of assumptions that allow identification and estimation of effects in the simple case of a single intervention, a temporally subsequent mediator and outcome. These assumptions include various no confounding assumptions including sequential ignorability assumptions and also interaction assumptions involving the treatment and mediator. The understanding of such assumptions is crucial since some can be assessed under certain conditions (e.g. treatment-mediator interactions), whereas others cannot (sequential ignorability). These issues become more complex with multiple mediators and longitudinal outcomes. In addressing these assumptions, we review several causal approaches to mediation analyses.},

In an effort to continue the bridging of this gap, this invited commentary relates the important issue of "natural direct effects" to the well-known epidemiologic method of direct standardization. Additionally, attention is paid to the importance of temporal sequencing to help substantiate the mediation relations among the exposure, mediation, and outcome. A crucial mathematical distortion under the logistics model, called "absence of collapsibility," is noted in motivating VanderWeele and Vansteelandt's use of the log-linear model for comparing the effect of exposure adjusted for the mediator with the effect of exposure unadjusted for the mediator. It is also noted that this issue applies to one approach to assessing confounding. Finally, some issues are raised for consideration when testing the interaction between the exposure and mediator before assessing mediation.},

	abstract = {The assessment of indirect effects is an important tool for epidemiologists interested in exploring the mechanisms of exposure-disease relations. A standard way of expressing an indirect effect is in terms of the "proportion explained"; this is the proportion of the total effect that is explained by a particular mediator (or set of mediators). There are several ways to calculate the proportion explained, based on both additive and multiplicative models. However, these standard methods (particularly those based on multiplicative models) have been criticized for lacking a causal interpretation. To address this issue, the author uses a framework of potential outcomes to define the indirect effects of interest (natural effects) and assess the correspondence between the natural effects and standard measures. The author finds that standard additive measures represent an unbiased weighted average of the effects of interest; standard multiplicative measures, on the other hand, yield a biased weighted average of these effects. If the investigator is primarily interested in whether or not an indirect effect exists, standard measures for mediation will often yield the correct answer. In contrast, if valid quantification of the indirect effect is desired, counterfactual-based methods should be used.},

The assessment of mediation is an important tool for addressing this criticism. By using mediation analysis to open the black box, underlying mechanisms of the observed associations can be described and causal inference improved. An explicit theoretical motivation for such an analysis has been missing from the epidemiological literature. To provide this motivation, we integrate literature from epidemiology and other social sciences to describe the reasons that an investigator might want to assess mediation.

To improve the understanding of mediation, we introduce a causal model for mediation that is grounded in the MSC approach. First, we describe an unbiased model for mediation, to clarify the causal meaning of previously described indirect effects. Through the use of potential outcomes and response types, we express each indirect (and direct) effect in terms of component causes within the MSC model. Second, we use an MSC-based model to illustrate a common cause of the mediator and outcome, i.e. a confounder of the mediator-outcome relationship. By describing this potential source of bias within the MSC-based model, important complexities are noted that impact the magnitude of plausible confounding. In conclusion, an MSC-based approach leads to several important insights concerning the interpretation of indirect and direct effects, as well as the potential sources of bias in mediation analysis.},

@article{Kaufman2004,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic research is often devoted to etiologic investigation, and so techniques that may facilitate mechanistic inferences are attractive. Some of these techniques rely on rigid and/or unrealistic assumptions, making the biologic inferences tenuous. The methodology investigated here is effect decomposition: the contrast between effect measures estimated with and without adjustment for one or more variables hypothesized to lie on the pathway through which the exposure exerts its effect. This contrast is typically used to distinguish the exposure's indirect effect, through the specified intermediate variables, from its direct effect, transmitted via pathways that do not involve the specified intermediates. METHODS: We apply a causal framework based on latent potential response types to describe the limitations inherent in effect decomposition analysis. For simplicity, we assume three measured binary variables with monotonic effects and randomized exposure, and use difference contrasts as measures of causal effect. Previous authors showed that confounding between intermediate and the outcome threatens the validity of the decomposition strategy, even if exposure is randomized. We define exchangeability conditions for absence of confounding of causal effects of exposure and intermediate, and generate two example populations in which the no-confounding conditions are satisfied. In one population we impose an additional prohibition against unit-level interaction (synergism). We evaluate the performance of the decomposition strategy against true values of the causal effects, as defined by the proportions of latent potential response types in the two populations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that even when there is no confounding, partition of the total effect into direct and indirect effects is not reliably valid. Decomposition is valid only with the additional restriction that the population contain no units in which exposure and intermediate interact to cause the outcome. This restriction implies homogeneity of causal effects across strata of the intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable effect decomposition requires not only absence of confounding, but also absence of unit-level interaction and use of linear contrasts as measures of causal effect. Epidemiologists should be wary of etiologic inference based on adjusting for intermediates, especially when using ratio effect measures or when absence of interacting potential response types cannot be confidently asserted.},

	abstract = {The concept of mediation has broad applications in medical health studies. Although the statistical assessment of a mediational effect under the normal assumption has been well established in linear structural equation models (SEM), it has not been extended to the general case where normality is not a usual assumption. In this paper, we propose to extend the definition of mediational effects through causal inference. The new definition is consistent with that in linear SEM and does not rely on the assumption of normality. Here, we focus our attention on the logistic mediation model, where all variables involved are binary. Three approaches to the estimation of mediational effects-Delta method, bootstrap, and Bayesian modelling via Monte Carlo simulation are investigated. Simulation studies are used to examine the behaviour of the three approaches. Measured by 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) coverage rate and root mean square error (RMSE) criteria, it was found that the Bayesian method using a non-informative prior outperformed both bootstrap and the Delta methods, particularly for small sample sizes. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed method to public health research using a nationally representative database. Extending the proposed method to other types of mediational model and to multiple mediators are also discussed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To estimate the direct and indirect pathways between education and diabetes. METHODS: We examined the relative contribution of eight different pathways between education and diabetes incidence over a 9-year period in Ontario, Canada. Our data source was respondents (35-60 years of age) to the 2000-2001 Canadian Community Health Survey individually linked with physician and hospital administrative data. Our sample contained 11,899 participants with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The direct and indirect effects of education level on incident diabetes were estimated using Aalen additive hazard models. RESULTS: Not having completed secondary education was associated with 120 extra diabetes cases per 10,000 men per year and 43 additional diabetes cases per 10,000 women per year, compared with having Bachelors education or higher. Body mass index accounted for 13 of the 120 extra diabetes cases among men, and 24 of the 43 additional diabetes cases for women. CONCLUSIONS: Of the mediating pathways examined in this paper, body mass index was the pathway through which the largest number of diabetes cases was mediated among men and women. A substantial number of excess diabetes cases among respondents with lower education levels, in particular among men, were not mediated through any of the eight pathways examined.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Investigators of the COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions for Alcoholism) study examined whether combining medications with a behavioral intervention would improve outcomes over monotherapies. Unexpectedly, the combination did not offer any advantage over either treatment alone. This study aimed to explain the lack of incremental benefit offered by the combination over either monotherapy by assessing the role of cravings as a treatment mediator and moderator. DESIGN: Secondary mediation and moderation analyses of COMBINE study data. SETTING: Eleven United States academic sites. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 863 patients randomized to one of four treatment groups: naltrexone (100 mg/day; n = 209), the combined behavioral intervention (CBI, n = 236), naltrexone and CBI combined (n = 213) and placebo naltrexone (n = 205). MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of days abstinent (PDA) measured between 13 and 16 weeks post-baseline. Cravings, the potential mediator/moderator, were measured at baseline, weeks 4 and 12 using the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale. FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, naltrexone, CBI and the combination all increased PDA by an additional 6-10 percentage points for those with high cravings (P < 0.05 for all three treatment groups). None had significant effects on PDA for those with low cravings. The effects of all three treatments were mediated at least partially by cravings; craving reduction explained 48-53% of treatment effects (P < 0.05 for all three treatment groups). Furthermore, naltrexone appeared to reduce cravings at 4 weeks, while CBI did not reduce cravings until 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions for Alcoholism (COMBINE) naltrexone + CBI combination may not be more beneficial than either monotherapy because craving reduction is a common mechanism of both.},

@article{VanderWeele2013,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: During the last 30 years, the use of prenatal care, both the proportion of women receiving the recommended number of visits and the average number of visits, has increased substantially. Although infant mortality has decreased, the incidence of preterm birth has increased. We hypothesized that prenatal care may lead to lower infant mortality in part by increasing the detection of obstetrical problems for which the clinical response may be to medically induce preterm birth. METHODS: We examined whether medically induced preterm birth mediates the association between prenatal care and infant mortality by using newly developed methods for mediation analysis. Data are the cohort version of the national linked birth certificate and infant death data for 2003 births. Analyses were adjusted for maternal sociodemographic, geographic, and health characteristics. RESULTS: Receiving more prenatal care visits than recommended was associated with medically induced preterm birth (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.40-2.49) compared with fewer visits than recommended). Medically induced preterm birth was itself associated with greater infant mortality (OR, 5.08; 95% CI, 4.61-5.60) but that association was weaker among women receiving extra prenatal care visits (OR 3.08; 95% CI, 2.88-3.30) compared with women receiving the recommended number of visits or fewer. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that some of the benefit of prenatal care in terms of infant mortality may be in part due to medically induced preterm birth. If so, the use of preterm birth rates as a metric for tracking birth policy and outcomes could be misleading.},

Data were obtained from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, with analyses limited to non-Hispanic white and black CSHCN (n = 14,677). The counterfactual approach to mediation analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for the natural direct and indirect effects of race on unmet healthcare needs. Overall, 43.0 % of white CSHCN and 60.4 % of black CSHCN did not have a medical home. Additionally, 8.8 % of white CSHCN and 15.3 % of black CSHCN had unmet healthcare needs. The natural indirect effect indicates that the odds of unmet needs among black CSHCN are elevated by approximately 20 % as a result of their current level of access to the medical home rather than access at a level equal to white CSHCN (OR(NIE) = 1.2, 95 % CI = 1.1, 1.3). The natural direct effect indicates that even if black CSHCN had the same level of access to a medical home as white CSHCN, blacks would still have 60 % higher odds of unmet healthcare needs than whites (OR(NDE) = 1.6, 95 % CI = 1.1, 2.4). The racial disparity in unmet healthcare needs among CSHCN is only partially explained by disparities in having a medical home. Ensuring all CSHCN have equal access to a medical home may reduce the racial disparity in unmet needs, but will not completely eliminate it.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early-life socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with adult chronic disease, but it is unclear whether this effect is mediated entirely via adult SES or whether there is a direct effect of adverse early-life SES on adult disease. Major challenges in evaluating these alternatives include imprecise measurement of early-life SES and bias in conventional regression methods to assess mediation. In particular, conventional regression approaches to direct effect estimation are biased when there is time-varying confounding of the association between adult SES and chronic disease by chronic disease risk factors. METHODS: First-reported heart disease, diabetes, and stroke diagnoses were assessed in a national sample of 9760 Health and Retirement Study participants followed biennially from 1992 through 2006. Early-life and adult SES measures were derived using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Early-life SES was measured by parental education, father's occupation, region of birth, and childhood rural residence. Adult SES was measured by respondent's education, occupation, labor force status, household income, and household wealth. Using marginal structural models, we estimated the direct effect of early-life SES on chronic disease onset that was not mediated by adult SES. Marginal structural models were estimated with stabilized inverse probability-weighted log-linear models to adjust for risk factors that may have confounded associations between adult SES and chronic disease. RESULTS: During follow-up, 24%, 18%, and 9% of participants experienced first onset of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, respectively. Comparing those in the most disadvantaged with the least disadvantaged quartile, early-life SES was associated with coronary heart disease (risk ratio = 1.30 [95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.51]) and diabetes (1.23 [1.02-1.48]) and marginally associated with stroke via pathways not mediated by adult SES. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that early-life socioeconomic experiences directly influence adult chronic disease outcomes.},

They demonstrate how total effects can be partitioned into direct and indirect effects even when the exposure and mediator interact. The impact of bias due to unmeasured confounding on the exposure-response association is assessed through a series of sensitivity analyses. These methods are applied to a problem in perinatal epidemiology to examine the extent to which the effect of abruption on perinatal mortality is mediated through preterm delivery. Data on over 26 million US singleton births (1995-2002) were utilized. Risks of mortality among abruption and nonabruption births were 102.7 and 6.2 per 1,000 births, respectively. Risk ratios of the natural direct and indirect (preterm delivery-mediated) effects of abruption on mortality were 10.18 (95% confidence interval: 9.80, 10.58) and 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.33, 1.38), respectively. The proportion of increased mortality risk mediated through preterm delivery was 28.1%, with even higher proportions associated with deliveries at earlier gestational ages. Sensitivity analyses underscore that the qualitative conclusions of some mediated effects and substantial direct effects are reasonably robust to unmeasured confounding of a fairly considerable magnitude.},

	annote = {Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(λ) random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(λ) distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects λin the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and λare unrelated; other times p is a simple function of λsuch as p=1/(1+λ$^{τ}$) for an unknown constant τ. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical scientists, policymakers, and individuals must make decisions concerning effective interventions that address health-related issues. We use longitudinal data on loneliness and depressive symptoms and a new class of causal models to illustrate how empirical evidence can be used to inform intervention trial design and clinical practice. METHOD: Data were obtained from a population-based study of non-Hispanic Caucasians, African Americans, and Latino Americans (N = 229) born between 1935 and 1952. Loneliness and depressive symptoms were measured with the UCLA Loneliness Scale-Revised and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, respectively. Marginal structural causal models were employed to evaluate the extent to which depressive symptoms depend not only on loneliness measured at a single point in time (as in prior studies of the effect of loneliness) but also on an individual's entire loneliness history. RESULTS: Our results indicate that if interventions to reduce loneliness by 1 standard deviation were made 1 and 2 years prior to assessing depressive symptoms, both would have an effect; together, they would result in an average reduction in depressive symptoms of 0.33 standard deviations, 95% CI [0.21, 0.44], p < .0001. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude and persistence of these effects suggest that greater effort should be devoted to developing practical interventions on alleviating loneliness and that doing so could be useful in the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms. In light of the persistence of the effects of loneliness, our results also suggest that, in the evaluation of interventions on loneliness, it may be important to allow for a considerable follow-up period in assessing outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: The common finding that low achieved hemoglobin in observational studies and high target hemoglobin in randomized trials each were associated with increased mortality and high epoetin dosage has suggested the possibility that high epoetin dosage might explain the increased mortality risk.Design, setting, participants, &amp; measurements: We considered data from 18,454 patients who were ‚{\^a}*65 yr, were in the US Renal Data System, started hemodialysis in 2003, and survived 3 mo on dialysis. We estimated the association between cumulative average epoetin dosage and survival through the subsequent 9 mo by using inverse probability weighting to adjust for time-dependent confounding by indication.Results: Survival was similar throughout the entire follow-up period for the three hypothetical treatment regimens selected: Low dosage 15,000 U/wk, medium dosage 30,000 U/wk, and high dosage 45,000 U/wk. Compared with a cumulative average dosage of 20,000 to 30,000 U/wk, the estimated hazard ratio (HR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) was 0.90 (0.52 to 1.54) for &lt;10,000, 0.84 (0.67 to 1.05) for 10,000 to &lt;20,000 U/wk, 0.96 (0.76 to 1.21) for 20,000 to &lt;40,000 U/wk, and 0.91 (0.67 to 1.22) for &gt;40,000 U/wk. In contrast, conventional unweighted models, which do not adequately adjust for time-dependent confounding by indication, indicated an association between high cumulative average epoetin dosage and increased mortality.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, on average, epoetin dosages &gt;30,000 U/wk do not confer additional harm or benefit in elderly hemodialysis patients.},

	abstract = {Objectives The healthy worker effect usually leads to underestimation of the association between occupational exposure and asthma. The role of irritants in work-related asthma is disputed. We estimated the effect of occupational exposure on asthma expression in a longitudinal study, using marginal structural modelling to control for the healthy worker effect.Methods Analyses included 1284 participants (17‚{\"A}{\`\i}79‚{\"A}{\"O}years, 48% men) from the follow-up (2003‚{\"A}{\`\i}2007) of the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (case-control study). Age at asthma onset, periods with/without attacks over lifetime and occupational history were recorded retrospectively. Exposures to known asthmagens, irritants or low level of chemicals/allergens were evaluated through a job-exposure matrix. The job history was reconstructed into 5-year intervals.Results Thirty-one per cent of subjects had ever been exposed to occupational asthmagens. Among the 38% of subjects who had asthma (ever), presence of attacks was reported in 52% of all time periods. Using standard analyses, no association was observed between exposure to known asthmagens (OR (95% CI): 0.99 (0.72 to 1.36)) or to irritants/low level of chemicals/allergens (0.82 (0.56 to 1.20)) and asthma attacks. Using a marginal structural model, all associations increased with suggestive evidence for known asthmagens (1.26 (0.90 to 1.76)), and reaching statistical significance for irritants/low level of chemicals/allergens (1.56 (1.02 to 2.40)).Conclusions The healthy worker effect has an important impact in risk assessment in work-related asthma studies. Marginal structural models are useful to eliminate imbalances in exposure due to disease-driven selection. Results support the role of irritants in work-related asthma.},

@article{VanderWeele2012a,
	abstract = {It is common practice in perinatal epidemiology to calculate gestational-age-specific or birth-weight-specific associations between an exposure and a perinatal outcome. Gestational age or birth weight, for example, might lie on a pathway from the exposure to the outcome. This practice of conditioning on a potential intermediate has come under critique for various reasons. First, if one is interested in assessing the overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, it is not necessary to stratify, and indeed, it is important not to stratify, on an intermediate. Second, if one does condition on an intermediate, to try to obtain what might conceived of as a "direct effect" of the exposure on the outcome, then various biases and paradoxical results can arise. It is now well documented theoretically and empirically that, when there is an unmeasured common cause of the intermediate and the outcome, associations adjusted for the intermediate are subject to bias. In this paper, we propose 3 approaches to facilitate valid inference when effects conditional on an intermediate are in view. These 3 approaches correspond to (i) conditioning on the predicted risk of the intermediate, (ii) conditioning on the intermediate itself in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, and (iii) conditioning on the subgroup of individuals for whom the intermediate would occur irrespective of the exposure received. The second and third approaches both require sensitivity analysis, and they result in a range of estimates. Each of the 3 approaches can be used to resolve the "birth-weight paradox" that exposures such as maternal smoking seem to have a protective effect among low-birth-weight infants. The various methodologic approaches described in this paper are applicable to a number of similar settings in perinatal epidemiology.},

	abstract = {The design of occupational epidemiology studies should be based on the need to minimise random and systematic error. The latter is the focus of this paper, and includes selection bias, information bias and confounding. Selection bias can be minimised by obtaining a high response rate (and by appropriate selection of the control group in a case-control study). In general, it is important to ensure that information bias is minimised and is also non-differential (for example, that the misclassification of exposure is not related to disease status) by collecting data in a standardised manner. A major concern in occupational epidemiology studies usually relates to confounding, because exposure has not been randomly allocated, and the groups under study may therefore have different baseline disease risks. For each of these types of bias, the goal should be to avoid the bias by appropriate study design and/or appropriate control in the analysis. However, it is also important to attempt to assess the likely direction and strength of biases that cannot be avoided or controlled.},

Using incidence rates, we studied how this underestimation varied according to subtypes of cancer by comparing a large cohort of randomly selected Norwegian workers hired between 1981 and 2003 (n = 366,114) with the general Norwegian population. The cohort was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway, including all new cancer cases (n = 11,271) reported up to 2003. We found marked potential for the healthy worker effect for overall cancer incidence in male workers (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.89, 0.93) but not in female workers (SIR = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.03). A statistically significantly lower incidence was found among men for cancers of the head and neck (SIR = 0.78), lung (SIR = 0.81), prostate (SIR = 0.93), kidney (SIR = 0.83), and bladder (SIR = 0.77) and for leukemia (SIR = 0.80), whereas an increased incidence was found for malignant melanoma among both men (SIR = 1.09) and women (SIR = 1.29) and for ovarian cancer in women (SIR = 1.32). Depending on the type of cancer being studied, marked potential exists for both underestimation and overestimation of cancer risk when the general population is used as the reference for studies of worker populations.},

Chrysotile asbestos exposure was measured in fiber-years per milliliter of air, and annual occupational exposures were estimated on the basis of detailed work histories. Sixteen percent of person-years involved exposure to asbestos, with a median exposure of 3.30 fiber-years/mL among those exposed. Lung cancer mortality by age 90 years under the observed asbestos exposure was 9.44%. In comparison with observed asbestos exposure, if the facility had operated under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration asbestos exposure standard of <0.1 fibers/mL, we estimate that the cohort would have experienced 24% less lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94).

	abstract = {The growing body of work in the epidemiology literature focused on G-computation includes theoretical explanations of the method but very few simulations or examples of application. The small number of G-computation analyses in the epidemiology literature relative to other causal inference approaches may be partially due to a lack of didactic explanations of the method targeted toward an epidemiology audience. The authors provide a step-by-step demonstration of G-computation that is intended to familiarize the reader with this procedure. The authors simulate a data set and then demonstrate both G-computation and traditional regression to draw connections and illustrate contrasts between their implementation and interpretation relative to the truth of the simulation protocol. A marginal structural model is used for effect estimation in the G-computation example. The authors conclude by answering a series of questions to emphasize the key characteristics of causal inference techniques and the G-computation procedure in particular.},

	annote = {In applied problems it is common to specify a model for the conditional mean of a response given a set of regressors. A subset of the regressors may be missing for some study subjects either by design or happenstance. In this article we propose a new class of semiparametric estimators, based on inverse probability weighted estimating equations, that are consistent for parameter vector α$_{0}$ of the conditional mean model when the data are missing at random in the sense of Rubin and the missingness probabilities are either known or can be parametrically modeled. We show that the asymptotic variance of the optimal estimator in our class attains the semiparametric variance bound for the model by first showing that our estimation problem is a special case of the general problem of parameter estimation in an arbitrary semiparametric model in which the data are missing at random and the probability of observing complete data is bounded away from 0, and then deriving a representation for the efficient score, the semiparametric variance bound, and the influence function of any regular, asymptotically linear estimator in this more general estimation problem. Because the optimal estimator depends on the unknown probability law generating the data, we propose locally and globally adaptive semiparametric efficient estimators. We compare estimators in our class with previously proposed estimators. We show that each previous estimator is asymptotically equivalent to some, usually inefficient, estimator in our class. This equivalence is a consequence of a proposition stating that every regular asymptotic linear estimator of α$_{0}$ is asymptotically equivalent to some estimator in our class. We compare various estimators in a small simulation study and offer some practical recommendations.},

	abstract = {<P>Generalized additive models (GAMs) have become an elegant and practical option in model building. Estimation of a smooth GAM component traditionally requires an algorithm that cycles through and updates each smooth, while holding other components at their current estimated fit, until specified convergence. We aim to fit all the smooth components simultaneously. This can be achieved using penalized B-spline or P-spline smoothers for every smooth component, thus transforming GAMs into the generalized linear model framework. Using a large number of equally spaced knots, P-splines purposely overfit each B-spline component. To reduce flexibility, a difference penalty on adjacent B-spline coefficients is incorporated into a penalized version of the Fisher scoring algorithm. Each component has a separate smoothing parameter, and the penalty is optimally regulated through extensions of cross validation or information criterion. An example using logistic additive models provides illustrations of the developments.</P>},

@article{Luo2006,
	abstract = {Background: Maternal socioeconomic status (SES) is an important determinant of inequity in maternal and fetal health. We sought to determine the extent to which associations between adverse birth outcomes and SES can be identified using individual-level measures (maternal level of education) and community-level measures (neighbourhood income).Methods: In Quebec, the birth registration form includes a field for the mother's years of education. Using data from birth registration certificates, we identified all births from 1991 to 2000. Using maternal postal codes that can be linked to census enumeration areas, we determined neighbourhood income levels that reflect SES.Results: Lower levels of both maternal education and neighbourhood income were associated with elevated crude risks of preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, stillbirth and neonatal and postneonatal death. The effects of maternal education were stronger than, and independent of, those of neighbourhood income. Compared with women in the highest neighbourhood income quintile, women in the lowest quintile were significantly more likely to have a preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10--1.17), SGA birth (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.15--1.21) or stillbirth (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13--1.48); compared with mothers who had completed community college or at least some university, mothers who had not completed high school were significantly more likely to have a preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.44--1.52), SGA birth (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.82--1.91) or stillbirth (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.36--1.74).Interpretation: Individual and, to a lesser extent, neighbourhood-level SES measures are independent indicators for subpopulations at risk of adverse birth outcomes. Women with lower education levels and those living in poorer neighbourhoods are more vulnerable to adverse birth outcomes and may benefit from heightened clinical vigilance and counselling.},

Although treatment regimes need not be binary in practice, the propensity score methods are generally confined to binary treatment scenarios. Two possible exceptions have been suggested for ordinal and categorical treatments. In this article we theory and methods that encompass all of these techniques and widen their applicability by allowing for arbitrary treatment regimes. We illustrate our propensity function methods by applying them to two datasets; we estimate the effect of smoking on medical expenditure and the effect of schooling on wages.

With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallow's C$_{p}$ procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

@article{Steenland2004,
	annote = {Dose-response modeling in occupational epidemiology is usually motivated by questions of causal inference (eg, is there a monotonic increase of risk with increasing exposure?) or risk assessment (eg, how much excess risk exists at any given level of exposure?). We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of "smoothing" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most "true" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios). Points are illustrated using data from a study of dioxin and cancer.},

METHODS: We propose an approach based on transformation and fractional polynomials which yields simple regression models with interpretable curves. We suggest a way of presenting the results from such models which involves tabulating the risks estimated from the model at convenient values of the risk factor. We discuss how to incorporate several continuous risk and confounding variables within a single model. The approach is exemplified with data from the Whitehall I study of British Civil Servants. We discuss the approach in relation to categorization and non-parametric regression models. RESULTS: We show that non-linear risk models fit the data better than linear models. We discuss the difficulties introduced by categorization and the advantages of the new approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach based on fractional polynomials should be considered as an important alternative to the traditional approaches for the analysis of continuous variables in epidemiological studies.},

	abstract = {In a longitudinal study of dose--response, it is often necessary to adjust for confounding or non-compliance, which may otherwise compromise the estimation of the true effect of a treatment. Using an approach based on the generalised propensity score (GPS) --a generalisation of the classical, binary treatment propensity score --it is possible to construct a balancing score that provides an estimation procedure for the true (unconfounded) direct effect of dose on response. Previously, the GPS has been applied only in a single interval setting; in this article, we extend the GPS methodology to the longitudinal setting to estimate the direct effect of a continuous dose on a longitudinal response. The methodology is applied to two simulated examples, and a real longitudinal dose--response investigation, the Monitored Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (MOTAS). In the treatment of childhood amblyopia, a common ophthalmological condition, occlusion therapy (patching) was for many decades the standard medical treatment, despite the fact that its efficacy was not quantified. MOTAS was revolutionary, as it was the first study to obtain precise measurements of the amount of occlusion each study participant received over the course of the study.},

@article{Kaufman2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Previous research has documented heterogeneity in the effects of maternal education on adverse birth outcomes by nativity and Hispanic subgroup in the United States. In this article, we considered the risk of preterm birth (PTB) using 9 years of vital statistics birth data from New York City. We employed finer categorizations of exposure than used previously and estimated the risk dose-response across the range of education by nativity and ethnicity.METHODS:Using Bayesian random effects logistic regression models with restricted quadratic spline terms for years of completed maternal education, we calculated and plotted the estimated posterior probabilities of PTB (gestational age < 37 weeks) for each year of education by ethnic and nativity subgroups adjusted for only maternal age, as well as with more extensive covariate adjustments. We then estimated the posterior risk difference between native and foreign born mothers by ethnicity over the continuous range of education exposures.RESULTS:The risk of PTB varied substantially by education, nativity and ethnicity. Native born groups showed higher absolute risk of PTB and declining risk associated with higher levels of education beyond about 10 years, as did foreign-born Puerto Ricans. For most other foreign born groups, however, risk of PTB was flatter across the education range. For Mexicans, Central Americans, Dominicans, South Americans and "Others", the protective effect of foreign birth diminished progressively across the educational range. Only for Puerto Ricans was there no nativity advantage for the foreign born, although small numbers of foreign born Cubans limited precision of estimates for that group.CONCLUSIONS:Using flexible Bayesian regression models with random effects allowed us to estimate absolute risks without strong modeling assumptions. Risk comparisons for any sub-groups at any exposure level were simple to calculate. Shrinkage of posterior estimates through the use of random effects allowed for finer categorization of exposures without restricting joint effects to follow a fixed parametric scale. Although foreign born Hispanic women with the least education appeared to generally have low risk, this seems likely to be a marker for unmeasured environmental and behavioral factors, rather than a causally protective effect of low education itself.},

        <p>Propensity score weighting is sensitive to model misspecification and outlying weights that can unduly influence results. The authors investigated whether trimming large weights downward can improve the performance of propensity score weighting and whether the benefits of trimming differ by propensity score estimation method. In a simulation study, the authors examined the performance of weight trimming following logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART), boosted CART, and random forests to estimate propensity score weights. Results indicate that although misspecified logistic regression propensity score models yield increased bias and standard errors, weight trimming following logistic regression can improve the accuracy and precision of final parameter estimates. In contrast, weight trimming did not improve the performance of boosted CART and random forests. The performance of boosted CART and random forests without weight trimming was similar to the best performance obtainable by weight trimmed logistic regression estimated propensity scores. While trimming may be used to optimize propensity score weights estimated using logistic regression, the optimal level of trimming is difficult to determine. These results indicate that although trimming can improve inferences in some settings, in order to consistently improve the performance of propensity score weighting, analysts should focus on the procedures leading to the generation of weights (i.e., proper specification of the propensity score model) rather than relying on ad-hoc methods such as weight trimming.</p>

(Am J Epidemiol. 2011;173(7):731--738) give a didactic explanation of G-computation as an approach for estimating the causal effect of a point exposure. The authors of the present commentary reinforce the idea that their use of G-computation is equivalent to a particular form of model-based standardization, whereby reference is made to the observed study population, a technique that epidemiologists have been applying for several decades. They comment on the use of standardized versus conditional effect measures and on the relative predominance of the inverse probability-of-treatment weighting approach as opposed to G-computation. They further propose a compromise approach, doubly robust standardization, that combines the benefits of both of these causal inference techniques and is not more difficult to implement.},

An analysis of which causes of death, in which age groups, are implicated in this trend is necessary to understand it and provide clear targets for intervention. METHODS: We analyzed Quebec mortality data for three 4-year periods from 1989-2004. Differences in life expectancy at birth between the most- and least-deprived areas in each period and over time were decomposed by age and cause of death for men and women using the Arriaga method. RESULTS: Life expectancy increased for all areas, but the increase was smaller in deprived areas. Cancer, heart disease and unintentional injuries accounted for the largest shares of inequality in each period. Among women, the widening life expectancy gap was largely due to increased lung cancer mortality. Among men, mortality from HIV was an important cause of widening inequality. Increasing inequality in both sexes was offset by a decrease in mortality from unintentional injuries in deprived areas (narrowing the gap between the most- and least-deprived areas). The largest share of inequality among women was due to deaths in the 65-and-over age group. Among men, the largest share shifted over time from middle-age to the 65-and-over age group. CONCLUSION: The widening life expectancy gap between advantaged and disadvantaged areas in Quebec is driven by relatively few causes of death with well-known risk factors and strategies for prevention.},

This study investigated age- and sex-specific life expectancy differentials related to area-level material deprivation for the province of Quebec, Canada from 1989-2004. METHODS: Age- and sex-specific life expectancy across the lifespan was calculated for three periods (1989-1992, 1995-1998, and 2001-2004) for the entire Quebec population residing in 162 community groupings ranked according to decile of material deprivation. Absolute and relative measures were calculated to summarize differences between the most and least deprived deciles. RESULTS: Life expectancy differentials between the most and least deprived deciles were greatest for men. Over time, male differentials increased for age 20 or more, with little change occurring at younger ages. For women, differentials increased across the lifespan and were comparable to men at advanced ages. Despite gains in life expectancy among men relative to women, differentials between men and women were greater for most deprived relative to least deprived deciles. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the US, differentials in life expectancy associated with area-level material deprivation increased steadily in Quebec from 1989-2004 for males and females of all ages. Differentials were comparable between men and women at advanced ages. Previous research indicating that life expectancy differentials between most and least deprived areas are greater in men may be due to a focus on younger age groups.},

	annote = {CONTEXT: Rural relative to urban area and low socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with adverse birth outcomes. Whether a graded association of increasing magnitude is present across the urban-rural continuum, accounting for SES, is unclear. We examined the association between rural-urban continuum, SES and adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Singleton births from 1999 to 2003 (n = 356,147) were linked to Quebec municipalities ranked on a continuum of 3 urban and 4 rural areas based on population and economic base. Maternal education was used to represent SES. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, accounting for municipality and individual-level covariates. We used stratified analyses to examine interaction between SES and rural-urban continuum. FINDINGS: Relative to metropolitan area residence, living in small urban or rural areas was associated with adverse birth outcomes. Living in rural areas was associated with SGA birth (OR 1.11, 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.17) and LBW (OR 1.15, 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.26), and living in small urban areas was associated with PTB (OR 1.14, 95{\%} CI 1.08-1.20). Upon stratification by education, living in remote rural relative to metropolitan areas was associated with adverse birth outcomes among university educated mothers only, and living in small urban areas was associated with adverse birth outcomes among mothers with lesser but not higher education. An SES gradient was present in all rural-urban areas, particularly for SGA birth. CONCLUSION: Differences in perinatal health exist across the rural-urban continuum, and maternal education has a modifying influence.},

We evaluated whether youth perceive that the imagery of a specific sports marketing advertisement contained smoking-related messages. METHODS: Twenty grade 7 to 11 classes (397 students) from two high schools in Montreal, Canada were recruited to participate in a cluster randomised single-blind controlled trial. Classes were randomly allocated to either a NIKE advertisement containing the phrase 'LIGHT IT UP' (n = 205) or to a neutral advertisement with smoking imagery reduced and the phrase replaced by 'GO FOR IT' (n = 192). The NIKE logo was removed from both advertisements. Students responded in class to a questionnaire asking open-ended questions about their perception of the messages in the ad. Reports relating to the appearance and text of the ad, and the product being promoted were evaluated. RESULTS: Relative to the neutral ad, more students reported that the phrase 'LIGHT IT UP' was smoking-related (37.6{\%} vs. 0.5{\%}) and that other parts of the ad resembled smoking-related products (50.7{\%} vs. 10.4{\%}). The relative risk of students reporting that the NIKE ad promoted cigarettes was 4.41 (95{\%} confidence interval: 2.64-7.36; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The unbranded imagery of an advertisement in a specific campaign aimed at promoting NIKE hockey products appears to have contained smoking-related messages. This particular marketing campaign may have promoted smoking. This suggests that the regulation of marketing to youth may need to be more tightly controlled.},

We performed a population-based retrospective analysis of live and still births in urban Quebec, 1981-2004 (N = 1,612,614 live births). Outcomes included: (1) first and second order SSR over four consecutive 6-year intervals analysed according to parental mother tongue, parental birth region, and mothers still speaking her mother tongue at home, (2) adjusted relative risk (RR) of female birth by parental ethnicity, and (3) estimated number of unborn females. For the period 1987-1992, first order SSRs were elevated (range 118-121) for Indo-Pakistani parental mother tongue and mothers currently speaking Indo-Pakistani at home. Second order SSRs were not elevated. For Indo-Pakistani mother tongues, the RR of female birth was lower than French/English in the same period (adjusted RR 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.92-0.99). SSRs were not imbalanced in the late 1990s among Indo-Pakistani parents, or among Chinese ethnicity in any study period. The SSR in Quebec was elevated in the 1980s and early 1990s among firstborn relative to subsequent born infants of Indo-Pakistani descent. The reason for this imbalance is unclear.

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Interpregnancy interval (IPI), marital status, and neighborhood are independently associated with birth outcomes. The joint contribution of these exposures has not been evaluated. We tested for effect modification between IPI and marriage, controlling for neighborhood. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 98,330 live births in Montreal, Canada from 1997-2001 to assess IPI and marital status in relation to small for gestational age (SGA) birth. Births were categorized as subsequent-born with short (<12 months), intermediate (12-35 months), or long (36+ months) IPI, or as firstborn. The data had a 2-level hierarchical structure, with births nested in 49 neighborhoods. We used multilevel logistic regression to obtain adjusted effect estimates. RESULTS: Marital status modified the association between IPI and SGA birth. Being unmarried relative to married was associated with SGA birth for all IPI categories, particularly for subsequent births with short (odds ratio {$[$}OR{$]$} 1.60, 95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} 1.31-1.95) and intermediate (OR 1.48, 95{\%} CI 1.26-1.74) IPIs. Subsequent births had a lower likelihood of SGA birth than firstborns. Intermediate IPIs were more protective for married (OR 0.50, 95{\%} CI 0.47-0.54) than unmarried mothers (OR 0.65, 95{\%} CI 0.56-0.76). CONCLUSION: Being unmarried increases the likelihood of SGA birth as the IPI shortens, and the protective effect of intermediate IPIs is reduced in unmarried mothers. Marital status should be considered in recommending particular IPIs as an intervention to improve birth outcomes.},

Neighbourhood constructs such as immigrant density, deprivation and crime have all been separately associated with birth outcomes. Little research has considered the joint influence of variables representing a spectrum of neighbourhood constructs. Subjective vs. objective measures of neighbourhood constructs (e.g. reported vs. perceived crime) are often not considered. We sought to evaluate the relationship between neighbourhood measures of reported crime, neighbourhood perceived security, immigrant density, material/social deprivation, residential stability and the odds of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth in an urban setting in Canada. Neighbourhood was defined as police districts (n = 49). We linked Montreal livebirths 1997-2001 (n = 98 330) to police district crime measures, survey data on perceived security, and 2001 census data. We used multi-level analysis to calculate odds ratios (OR) for neighbourhood effects on SGA birth accounting for individual characteristics. Mothers residing in neighbourhoods with the most favourable perception had a lower odds of SGA birth than neighbourhoods with the least favourable perception {$[$}OR 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.77, 0.97{$]$}. Mothers in neighbourhoods with lower proportions of immigrants had lower odds of SGA birth relative to neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of immigrants. Reported crime, residential stability and material/social deprivation (accounting for neighbourhood perception) were not associated with SGA birth. Immigrant density and subjective perceptions of neighbourhood security are associated with SGA birth. Public health strategies to improve fetal growth should target neighbourhoods with low perceived security and high immigrant density.},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Associations between risk factors and perinatal outcomes may be biased at preterm gestational ages, if preterm delivery behaves as an effect modifier due to other unmeasured factors in the causal pathway. We evaluated whether fetuses-at-risk denominators could be used in regression models instead of conventional denominators to obtain less biased estimates of the association between maternal education and stillbirth at preterm gestational intervals. METHODS: Data included 2,143,134 live-born and 8946 stillborn singletons from 1981 through 2006 in Quebec, Canada. Odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals were estimated for the relationship between education and stillbirth according to cause of fetal death, adjusting for maternal age, marital status, home language, parity, and period. We examined associations for 4 gestational intervals (<28, 28-31, 32-36, and >/=37 completed weeks), using both conventional denominators (ie, preterm live births) and fetuses-at-risk denominators. RESULTS: Stillbirth rates were greater for mothers with fewer years of education at all gestational intervals. Using conventional denominators, low education (relative to high education) was more strongly associated with term than preterm stillbirth and was apparently protective at <28 weeks. Using fetuses-at-risk denominators, low education was more strongly associated with preterm stillbirth than term stillbirth, even at <28 weeks. Low education was most strongly associated with diabetic-related stillbirth at >/=28 weeks (odds ratio = 5.04) relative to high education. CONCLUSIONS: Low education is associated with stillbirth throughout gestation, especially diabetic-related stillbirth. Use of fetuses-at-risk denominators in regression models can avoid potentially biased estimates obtained with conventional denominators at preterm gestational ages.},

RESULTS: There were 14.4 late abortions per 100,000 overall pregnancies {$[$}95{\%} confidence interval 12.9, 16.1{$]$}, and rates appeared to increase with time. Mean gestational age (24.7 weeks) and birth weight (886 g) suggested that abortions were performed in the late second and third trimesters. CONCLUSIONS: Late abortions in Quebec are not common but do occur. Research is needed to determine whether the increase in rates over time reflects better reporting or a true increase. Improved surveillance of late abortions may be warranted.},

METHODS: We evaluated singleton live births for Quebec residents, 1981-2008 (n = 2,310,466). Municipality of residence (Inuit-inhabited, First Nations-inhabited, rest of Quebec) and language (Inuit, First Nations, French/English) were used to identify Inuit and First Nations births. The outcome was PTB (<37 completed weeks). Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) of PTB, adjusting for maternal age, education, marital status, parity and birth year. RESULTS: PTB rates were higher for Inuit language speakers in Inuit-inhabited areas and the rest of Quebec compared with French/English speakers in the rest of Quebec, and disparities persisted over time. Relative to French/English speakers in the rest of Quebec, Inuit language speakers in the rest of Quebec had the highest risk of PTB (HR 1.98, 95{\%} CI: 1.62-2.41). The risk was also elevated for Inuit language speakers in Inuit-inhabited areas, though to a lesser extent (HR 1.29, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-1.41). In contrast, First Nations language speakers in First Nations-inhabited areas and the rest of Quebec had similar or lower risks of PTB relative to French/English speakers in the rest of Quebec. CONCLUSIONS: Inuit populations, especially those outside Inuit-inhabited areas, have persistently elevated risks of PTB, indicating a need for strategies to prevent PTB in this population.},

METHODS: Live births in Quebec, Canada, were obtained for 1990-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2006. Mean maternal education and proportion of females with no high school diploma were expressed as continuous cumulative rank scores for 10,923 neighborhoods. We estimated the relative hazard of PTB (<37 gestational weeks) for neighborhood education in each period by using Cox proportional hazards regression, accounting for individual education, age, marital status, birthplace, language, parity, infant sex, rurality, neighborhood income, and area clustering. Adjusted absolute differences in the prevalence of PTB between the most and least educated neighborhoods were calculated. RESULTS: PTB prevalence (6.1{\%} overall) was greater in less-educated neighborhoods. Although PTB proportions increased over time in all neighborhoods, the increase was proportionately greater for less-educated areas. Hazards of PTB for neighborhood education were proportional over gestation. Depending on the indicator of neighborhood education and period, adjusted hazards of PTB were 10{\%}-37{\%} greater for the least relative to most educated neighborhoods, and prevalence percentage differences ranged from 0.6{\%} to 1.9{\%}. Associations persisted over time. CONCLUSIONS: Relative and absolute neighborhood educational inequalities in PTB, independent of individual education, were present and persistent over time.},

Whether such associations vary according to social class indicators beyond race has not been assessed. METHODS: This study evaluated effect modification by maternal birthplace and education of the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and birth outcomes of newborns from 1999-2003 in the province of Quebec, Canada (N = 353,120 births). Areas (N = 143) were defined as administrative local health service delivery districts. Multi-level logistic regression was used to model the association between three area characteristics (median household income, immigrant density and income inequality) and the two outcomes preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. Effect modification by social class indicators was evaluated in analyses stratified according to maternal birthplace and education. RESULTS: Relative to the lowest tertile, high median household income was associated with SGA birth among Canadian-born mothers (odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 1.20) and mothers with high school education or less (OR 1.13, 95{\%} CI 1.02, 1.24). Associations between median household income and PTB were weaker. Relative to the highest tertile, low immigrant density was associated with a lower odds of PTB among foreign-born mothers (OR 0.79, 95{\%} CI 0.63, 1.00) but a higher odds of PTB among Canadian-born mothers (OR 1.14, 95{\%} CI 1.07, 1.21). Associations with income inequality were weak or absent. CONCLUSION: The association between area factors and birth outcomes is modified by maternal birthplace and education. Studies have found that race interacts in a similar manner. Public health policies focussed on perinatal health must consider the interaction between individual and area characteristics.},

Results were similar for female post-working age mortality. There was no relation between income inequality and mortality in immigrants.

We evaluated the life expectancy gap between the Francophone majority and Anglophone minority of Quebec, Canada, both over time and across major provincial areas. Arriaga's method was used to estimate the age and cause of death groups contributing to changes in the life expectancy gap at birth between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006, and to evaluate patterns across major provincial areas (metropolitan Montreal, other metropolitan centres, and small cities/rural areas). Life expectancy at birth was greater for Anglophones, but the gap decreased over time by 1.3 years (52{\%} decline) in men and 0.9 years (47{\%} decline) in women, due to relatively sharper reductions in Francophone mortality from several causes, except lung cancer which countered reductions in women. The life expectancy gap in 2002-2006 was widest in other metropolitan centres (men 5.1 years, women 3.2 years), narrowest in small cities/rural areas (men 0.8 years, women 0.7 years), and tobacco-related causes were the main contributors. Only young Anglophones <40 years in small cities/rural areas had mortality higher than Francophones, resulting in a narrower gap in these areas. Differentials in life expectancy favouring Anglophones decreased over time, but varied across areas of Quebec. Tobacco-related causes accounted for the majority of the current life expectancy gap.},

This study evaluated whether maternal residential proximity to power transmission lines was associated with adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Live singleton births in the Montreal and Quebec census metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2004 were extracted from the Quebec birth file (N=707,215). Proximity was defined as residing within 400 m of a transmission line. Generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate associations between residential proximity to transmission lines and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth and infant sex, accounting for maternal age, education, marital status, ethnicity, parity, period of birth, and neighbourhood median household income. RESULTS: There was no association between residential proximity to transmission lines and PTB, LBW and infant sex in unadjusted and adjusted models. A lower likelihood of SGA birth was present for some distance categories (eg, adjusted OR 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.81 to 0.95 for 50-75 m relative to >/=400 m). CONCLUSION: Residential proximity to transmission lines is not associated with adverse births outcomes.},

	annote = {Methylmercury is a neurotoxicant that bio-accumulates in the aquatic food chain and is present in all fish. Little is known about the effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury in adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between long-term methylmercury exposure and neurological abnormalities in aboriginal Quebec Cree adults for whom fish is a dietary staple. We re-analysed data from a 1977 cross-sectional study conducted by Kofman and collaborators on a group of Quebec Cree individuals claiming ill health from local fish consumption. In the original 1977 study, 306 adult participants aged 18-82 years were assessed for methylmercury exposure. Tremor and other neurologic outcomes were assessed with a clinical examination. The investigators did not find clinical evidence of methylmercury intoxication based on an analysis of covariance. We used ordinal regression to obtain odds ratios for the relationship between total hair mercury levels and neurologic abnormalities. Hair mercury concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 46 ppm (parts per million). A 6 ppm increase in hair mercury was associated with increasing levels of tremor (OR, 2.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.15-4.26) in adults under 40 years of age. There was no association with nine other outcomes considered, nor with tremor among older persons. Odds ratios were not influenced by gender, smoking, alcohol use, or co-morbidity. CONCLUSION:: Dose-dependent effects of methylmercury on tremor may occur below the commonly accepted 50 ppm threshold, particularly in young adults. These effects may be detectable by clinical examination. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given that alcohol use was probably under-reported and that multiple outcomes were studied.},

	annote = {To clarify the relationship between preterm birth (PTB) and extreme weather events, we evaluated PTB during a January 1998 ice storm that had led to a provincial emergency in the middle of winter in the province of Quebec, Canada. Singleton live births for three periods (1993-1997, 1998, 1999-2003) were obtained (N = 855,320). PTB was defined as gestational age <37 completed weeks. Births in the Triangle of Darkness, the area most strongly affect by the storm, were geocoded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the likelihood of PTB for the Triangle relative to metropolitan Montreal, adjusting for maternal age, education, civil status, maternal birthplace, and previous deliveries. Associations for 1998 relative to other periods were evaluated. Short-term (January-February) and long-term (March-October) exposure periods were examined. The proportion PTB for 1998 January-February births in the Triangle (8.7{\%}) was high compared with 1998 March-October births (6.0{\%}) and with the corresponding proportions for 1993-1997 (6.2{\%}) and 1999-2003 (6.9{\%}). Covariate-adjusted odds of PTB for January-February 1998 were 27{\%} higher for the Triangle relative to metropolitan Montreal, though precision was low. Furthermore, adjusted odds were 28{\%} higher for 1998 relative to 1999-2003, despite increasing rates of PTB over time. Odds were not elevated over a long-term exposure period. This study suggests a weak association between PTB and exposure to extreme weather for the two months following an ice storm, but not for later periods after the storm.},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality, but the relationship between comorbidity and PTB by clinical subtype and severity of gestational age remains poorly understood. We evaluated associations between maternal comorbidities and PTB by clinical subtype and gestational age. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,329,737 singleton births delivered in hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada, 1989-2006. PTB was classified by clinical subtype (medically indicated, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), spontaneous preterm labour) and gestational age (< 28, 28-31, 32-36 completed weeks). Odds ratios (OR) of PTB by clinical subtype for systemic and localized maternal comorbidities were estimated using polytomous logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, grand multiparity, and period. Attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: PTB rates were higher among mothers with comorbidity (10.9{\%}) compared to those without comorbidity (4.7{\%}). Several comorbidities were associated with greater odds of medically indicated PTB compared with no comorbidity, but only comorbidities localized to the reproductive system were associated with spontaneous PTB. Drug dependence and mental disorders were strongly associated with PPROM and spontaneous PTBs across all gestational ages (OR > 2.0). At the population level, several major comorbidities (placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, oliogohydramnios, structural abnormality, cervical incompetence) were key contributors to all clinical subtypes of PTB, especially at < 32 weeks. Major systemic comorbidities (preeclampsia, anemia) were key contributors to PPROM and medically indicated PTBs. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between comorbidity and clinical subtypes of PTB depends on gestational age. Prevention of PPROM and spontaneous PTB may benefit from greater attention to preeclampsia, anemia and comorbidities localized to the reproductive system.},

SETTING: Montreal, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 628 adult students aged 12.6 years on average at cohort inception. MEASUREMENTS: Impulsivity and SES (parent education, area deprivation) were collected during secondary school. Age of gambling onset was collected retrospectively when participants were aged 20.3 years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the association between time to first report of gambling and interaction terms for each of impulsivity and parent education, and impulsivity and area deprivation accounting for sex and ethnicity. FINDINGS: Median (interquartile range) age of gambling onset was 17.0 (4.0) years. Impulsivity independently increased the risk of gambling onset among participants with no university-educated parent {$[$}hazard ratio (HR) 1.3; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.1-1.5{$]$} and those living in highly deprived areas (HR 1.7; 1.5-2.0). Impulsivity was not associated with gambling onset among high SES youth. Among participants with high impulsivity, risks were elevated for those with no university-educated parent relative to one or more university-educated parent (HR 1.7; 1.1-2.7), and for participants living in deprived relative to advantaged areas (HR 5.0; 2.6-9.6). SES was not associated with gambling onset among participants with low impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Impulsivity is a risk factor for gambling onset among low but not high SES youth, and low SES influences gambling onset primarily among impulsive youth. Gambling prevention programmes may need to consider potential interaction between impulsivity and SES.},

METHODS: Grade 7 students (n = 647) from 10 Montreal secondary schools were followed for 8 years. Relative age was expressed as years above or below the school-specific grade 7 median age. Hazard ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between relative age and age of gambling onset, with adjustment for sex, ethnicity, parent education, and impulsivity. RESULTS: A greater proportion of students in the youngest quartile gambled compared with the oldest (85.8{\%} vs 74.7{\%}). Hazards of gambling onset for students younger than the median age were elevated after age 10.5 years, but hazards were protective beforehand. At age 17 years, for example, the hazard for gambling onset was 61{\%} greater (95{\%} CI 1.4-1.9) for youth who were 1 year younger, but at age 8 years the hazard was 23{\%} lower (95{\%} CI 0.7-0.9).

	annote = {INTRODUCTION: The unresolved "epidemiological paradox" concerns the association between low socioeconomic status and unexpectedly favourable birth outcomes in foreign born mothers. The "healthy migrant" effect concerns the association between foreign born status per se and birth outcomes. The epidemiological paradox and healthy migrant effect were analysed for newborns in a favourable sociopolitical environment. METHODS: 98,330 live births to mothers in Montreal, Canada from 1997 to 2001 were analysed. Mothers were categorised as foreign born versus Canadian born. Outcomes were: small for gestational age (SGA) birth; low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the interaction between maternal education and foreign born status, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Not having a high school diploma was associated with LBW in Canadian (odds ratio (OR) 3.20; 95{\%} CI 2.61 to 3.91) but not foreign born (OR 1.14; 95{\%} CI 0.99 to 2.10) mothers and was more strongly associated with SGA birth in Canadian (OR 2.03; 95{\%} CI 1.84 to 2.22) than in foreign born (OR 1.26; 95{\%} CI 1.07 to 1.49) mothers. Foreign born status was associated with SGA birth (OR 1.37; 95{\%} CI 1.28 to 1.47), LBW (OR 1.51; 95{\%} CI 1.27 to 1.79) and PTB (OR 1.12; 95{\%} CI 1.03 to 1.22) in university-educated mothers only. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological paradox associated with low educational attainment was present for SGA birth and LBW but not PTB. Foreign born status was associated with adverse birth outcomes in university-educated mothers, the opposite of the healthy migrant effect.},

METHODS: Odds ratios and rate differences in preterm birth (PTB, <37 gestational weeks) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth were computed for Anglophones relative to Francophones for singleton live births in Quebec from 1981 to 2008 (N = 2,292,237), adjusting for maternal characteristics. Trends over time and residential region were evaluated. RESULTS: Rates of PTB and SGA birth overall were lower for Anglophones relative to Francophones, but temporal and regional trends varied by outcome. Although PTB rates increased over time, inequalities between Francophones and Anglophones were relatively stable. In contrast, inequalities in SGA birth narrowed over time as Francophone rates declined more than Anglophones. Inequalities in SGA birth favored Anglophones overall, but the gap gradually reversed in Montreal (the largest metropolitan center) to currently favor Francophones. CONCLUSIONS: PTB and SGA birth rates favored Anglophones over Francophones. The linguistic gap was generally stable over time for PTB, but narrowed or reversed for SGA birth. Language may be used to capture inequalities in perinatal health in countries where different linguistic groups predominate.},

	annote = {PURPOSE: Time trends in educational inequalities in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth are important to evaluate for policy, especially at preterm gestational ages when morbidity and mortality are typically greater. We evaluated educational inequalities in preterm and term SGA birth over time, accounting for potential bias at preterm gestational ages. METHODS: Data included 2,204,056 singleton live births from 25 to 43 gestational weeks, 1981 to 2007. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and percent prevalence differences (PPD) of preterm and term SGA birth for a continuous education score, accounting for maternal characteristics. Sensitivity analyses included correction for misclassification of preterm SGA status, and use of fetuses-at-risk denominators in regression models. RESULTS: Although prevalence of SGA birth decreased over time, relative educational inequalities (PRs) persisted for preterm and term cases. PPDs decreased slightly, but more for term than preterm SGA birth. Sensitivity analyses indicated that PRs for education were stronger for preterm than term SGA birth. PPDs were larger for term SGA birth in the first period, but greater for preterm SGA birth in the last period. CONCLUSIONS: Relative educational inequalities in SGA birth persisted over time. The difference in prevalence between the least and most educated mothers is currently greater for preterm than for term SGA birth.},

	annote = {OBJECTIVES: The relationship between electromagnetic field exposure and stillbirth has not been evaluated. We assessed associations between residential proximity to extremely low frequency power transmission lines and stillbirth across gestational age. METHODS: Data included singleton live births (N=514,826) and stillbirths (N=2033) for 1998-2007 in metropolitan areas of Quebec, Canada. Using power transmission line maps, the distances between lines and residential six-digit postal codes (<25, 25-49.9, 50-74.9, 75-99.9, >/= 100 m) were calculated. Generalised estimating equations were used to compute ORs and 95{\%} CIs for distance and stillbirth, accounting for individual and area characteristics. Early preterm (< 28 weeks), late preterm (28-36 weeks) and term (>/= 37 weeks) stillbirths were examined relative to fetuses-at-risk. RESULTS: There was no association between distance and preterm stillbirth. The odds of term stillbirth for <25 m were greater compared to >/= 100 m (OR 2.25, 95{\%} CI 1.14 to 4.45), but no dose-response pattern was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: A graded dose-response trend between distance to lines and odds of stillbirth was not found, but the likelihood of term stillbirth was elevated for residences within 25 m of power transmission lines. Residential proximity to transmission lines is unlikely to be associated with stillbirth, but more research is needed to rule out a possible link.},

	annote = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between preterm birth (PTB) and maternal education over time. We sought to determine whether educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: The authors analysed 2,124,909 singleton live births from 1981 to 2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) with 95{\%} CIs for the relationship between maternal education and extreme, very or moderate PTB (</=27, 28-31, and 32-36 completed weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex. RESULTS: Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95{\%} CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981-1985 to 3.11 (95{\%} CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001-2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were 1.53 (95{\%} CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95{\%} CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11{\%} vs 0.28{\%}) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67{\%} vs 3.11{\%}). Absolute differences in the proportion very PTB did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and moderate PTB have increased over time in Quebec. Relative increases were largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate PTB.},

This study evaluated community-level income inequality in relation to age- and cause-specific mortality. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological analysis. METHODS: Mortality data were extracted from the Quebec, Canada registry for 1999-2003. For Quebec communities (n=143), directly standardized mortality rates were calculated for all-cause (overall, working-age and post-working-age), suicide, alcohol, tobacco and cardiovascular mortality. Using 2001 Canada Census data, the tertiles of income inequality measured as the decile ratio, coefficient of variation and median share were calculated. The relative risk (RR) of death was determined using Poisson regression, accounting for median community income, family structure and rural-urban area. RESULTS: Income inequality was most strongly associated with alcohol-related mortality (RR(CoefficientVariation) 0.85, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.77-0.94), followed by statistically significant but weaker inverse associations with tobacco-related and age-specific all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Income inequality in Quebec communities is inversely associated with mortality outcomes, particularly alcohol-related mortality. These associations contrast with positive or null associations observed in studies of larger US and Canadian metropolitan areas, respectively. Community-level studies accounting for individual-level covariates are necessary to clarify the relationship between income inequality and mortality.},

	abstract = {Marginal structural models (MSM) provide a powerful tool to control for confounding by a time-dependent covariate without inappropriately adjusting for its role as a variable affected by treatment (Hern{\'a}n et al., 2000). In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to fit a marginal structural Cox model directly, rather than the typical approach of using pooled logistic regression, using the weighted Cox proportional hazards function that has been implemented in standard software. To evaluate the performance of the marginal structural Cox model directly via inverse probability of treatment weighting, we conducted several simulation studies based on two data-generating models: one which replicates the simulations of Young et al. (2009) and an additional, more clinically plausible approach which mimics survival data with time-dependent confounders and time-varying treatment. Using the simulations, we illustrate the limitations of the conventional time-dependent Cox model and the MSM fitted via pooled logistic regression. Furthermore, we propose two novel normalized weights with the goal of reducing the MSM estimators' variability. The performance of the normalized weights is evaluated alongside the usual unstabilized and stabilized weights.},

This permits a statistical regression analysis of the intensity of a recurrent event allowing for complicated censoring patterns and time dependent covariates.

	is not perfect so that the receipt of treatment is nonignorable.
	To address the problems associated with comparing subjects by the
	ignorable assignment-an ``intention-to-treat analysis''-we make use
	of instrumental variables, which have long been used by economists
	in the context of regression models with constant treatment effects.
	We show that the instrumental variables (IV) estimand can be embedded
	within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and that under some simple and
	easily interpretable assumptions, the IV estimand is the average
	causal effect for a subgroup of units, the compliers. Without these
	assumptions, the IV estimand is simply the ratio of intention-to-treat
	causal estimands with no interpretation as an average causal effect.
	The advantages of embedding the IV approach in the RCM are that it
	clarifies the nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal
	interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity of
	the results to deviations from key assumptions in a straightforward
	manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of veteran status

@article{Arrighi1996,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This investigation sought to examine whether methods proposed
	to control the healthy worker survivor effect would influence the
	shape or magnitude of the dose-response curve for respiratory cancer
	induced by arsenic. METHODS: Results from an unadjusted analysis
	are compared with results obtained by applying four different methods
	for control of the healthy worker survivor effect to data on arsenic
	exposure and respiratory cancer. The four methods are: exposure lag,
	adjustment for work status, cohort restriction, and the G null test.
	RESULTS: Cohort restriction gave erratic results depending upon the
	minimum years of follow up used. Exposure lag substantially increased
	the rate ratios and a non-linear shape (decreasing slope) compared
	with an unlagged analysis. Adjusting for work status (currently employed
	upsilon retired or otherwise not employed) yielded slightly higher
	rate ratios than an unadjusted analysis, with an overall shape similar
	to the baseline analysis. Results from the G null test procedure
	of Robins (1986), although not directly comparable with the baseline
	analysis, did show an adverse effect of exposure that seemed to reach
	a maximum when exposure was lagged between 10 and 20 years. CONCLUSIONS:
	All results confirm an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on respiratory
	cancer. In these data, it seems that the healthy worker survivor
	effect was not strong enough to mask the strong effect of arsenic
	exposure on respiratory cancer. Nevertheless, several methods show
	a stronger association between arsenic exposure and respiratory cancer
	after adjustment for the healthy worker survivor effect, suggesting
	that for weaker causal associations, studies not controlling for
	this source of bias will have low power to detect results. Although
	the G methods are theoretically the most unbiased, further work elucidating
	the validity of the assumptions underlying lagging, adjustment for
	work status, and the G methods are needed before clear recommendations
	can be made.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many years it has been claimed that observational
	studies find stronger treatment effects than randomized, controlled
	trials. We compared the results of observational studies with those
	of randomized, controlled trials. METHODS: We searched the Abridged
	Index Medicus and Cochrane data bases to identify observational studies
	reported between 1985 and 1998 that compared two or more treatments
	or interventions for the same condition. We then searched the Medline
	and Cochrane data bases to identify all the randomized, controlled
	trials and observational studies comparing the same treatments for
	these conditions. For each treatment, the magnitudes of the effects
	in the various observational studies were combined by the Mantel-Haenszel
	or weighted analysis-of-variance procedure and then compared with
	the combined magnitude of the effects in the randomized, controlled
	trials that evaluated the same treatment. RESULTS: There were 136
	reports about 19 diverse treatments, such as calcium-channel-blocker
	therapy for coronary artery disease, appendectomy, and interventions
	for subfertility. In most cases, the estimates of the treatment effects
	from observational studies and randomized, controlled trials were
	similar. In only 2 of the 19 analyses of treatment effects did the
	combined magnitude of the effect in observational studies lie outside
	the 95 percent confidence interval for the combined magnitude in
	the randomized, controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: We found little evidence

	after 1984 are either consistently larger than or qualitatively different

	variables (IV), the importance of which for empirical work has not
	been fully appreciated. First, the use of instruments that explain
	little of the variation in the endogenous explanatory variables can
	lead to large inconsistencies in the IV estimates even if only a
	weak relationship exists between the instruments and the error in
	the structural equation. Second, in finite samples, IV estimates
	are biased in the same direction as ordinary least squares (OLS)
	estimates. The magnitude of the bias of IV estimates approaches that
	of OLS estimates as the R<sup>2</sup> between the instruments and
	the endogenous explanatory variable approaches 0. To illustrate these
	problems, we reexamine the results of a recent paper by Angrist and
	Krueger, who used large samples from the U.S. Census to estimate
	wage equations in which quarter of birth is used as an instrument
	for educational attainment. We find evidence that, despite huge sample
	sizes, their IV estimates may suffer from finite-sample bias and
	may be inconsistent as well. These findings suggest that valid instruments
	may be more difficult to find than previously imagined. They also
	indicate that the use of large data sets does not necessarily insulate
	researchers from quantitatively important finite-sample biases. We

	abstract = {Background: Studies of autoworkers exposed to straight metalworking
	fluids report excess risks of several cancers. These studies, however,
	have not addressed the healthy-worker survivor effect. Most methods
	proposed to address this bias do not consider that it may be caused
	by time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. G-estimation
	of accelerated failure-time models was developed to handle this issue
	but has never been applied to account for the healthy-worker survivor
	effect. Methods: We compare results from Cox models and g-estimation
	in 38,747 autoworkers exposed to straight metalworking fluids. Exposure
	was defined based on job records and air samples. We examine relationships
	between duration of exposure and mortality from all causes, cancers,
	ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
	(COPD). Results: In standard models, hazard ratios were elevated
	for cancers of the larynx, prostate, and rectum, but below or approximately
	equal to 1.0 for all other outcomes considered. Adjustment for the
	healthy-worker survivor effect using time off work, employment status,
	time since hire, and restriction to inactive workers after 15 years
	of follow-up did not substantially change the hazard ratios. However,
	g-estimation yielded higher hazard ratios than standard Cox models
	for most outcomes. Exposure was related to increased risks of mortality
	from all causes combined, heart disease, COPD, and all cancers, as
	well as lung and prostate cancers. Conclusions: G-estimation may
	provide a better control for the healthy-worker survivor effect than

	cumulative odds ratios for one or more exposures. RESULTS: Two examples
	demonstrate that the proposed method provides increased flexibility

	These methods remain rarely used despite the ubiquity of measurement
	error. METHODS: Treating measurement error as a missing-data problem,
	the authors show how multiple-imputation for measurement-error (MIME)
	correction can be done using SAS software and evaluate the approach
	with a simulation experiment. RESULTS: Based on hypothetical data
	from a planned cohort study of 600 children with chronic kidney disease,
	the estimated hazard ratio for end-stage renal disease from the complete
	data was 2.0 [95% confidence limits (95% CL) 1.4, 2.8] and was reduced
	to 1.5 (95% CL 1.1, 2.1) using a misclassified exposure of low glomerular
	filtration rate at study entry (sensitivity of 0.9 and specificity
	of 0.7). The MIME correction hazard ratio was 2.0 (95% CL 1.2, 3.3),
	the regression calibration (RC) hazard ratio was 2.0 (95% CL 1.1,
	3.7), and restriction to a 25% validation substudy yielded a hazard
	ratio of 2.0 (95% CL 1.0, 3.7). Based on Monte Carlo simulations
	across eight scenarios, MIME was approximately unbiased, had approximately
	correct coverage, and was sometimes more powerful than misclassified
	or RC analyses. Using root mean squared error as a criterion, the
	MIME bias correction is sometimes outweighed by added imprecision.
	CONCLUSION: The choice between MIME and RC depends on performance,
	ease, and objectives. The usefulness of MIME correction in specific
	applications will depend upon the sample size or the proportion validated.
	MIME correction may be valuable in interpreting imperfectly measured
	epidemiological data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In epidemiologic research, little emphasis has been placed
	on methods to account for left-hand censoring of 'exposures' due
	to a limit of detection (LOD). METHODS: We calculate the odds of
	anti-HIV therapy naivete in 45 HIV-infected men as a function of
	measured log(10) plasma HIV RNA viral load using five approaches
	including ad hoc methods as well as a maximum likelihood estimate
	(MLE). We also generated simulations of a binary outcome with 10%
	incidence and a 1.5-fold increased odds per log increase in a log-normally
	distributed exposure with 25, 50 and 75% of exposure data below LOD.
	Simulated data were analysed using the same five methods, as well
	as the full data. RESULTS: In the example, the estimated odds ratio
	(OR) varied by 1.22-fold across methods, from 1.45 to 1.77 per log(10)
	copies of viral load and the standard error for the log OR varied
	by 1.52-fold across methods, from 0.31 to 0.47. In the simulations,
	use of full data or the MLE was unbiased with appropriate confidence
	interval (CI) coverage. However, as the proportion of exposure below
	LOD increased, substituting LOD, LOD/ radical 2 or LOD/2 was increasingly
	biased with increasingly inappropriate CI coverage. Finally, exclusion
	of values below LOD was unbiased but imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: In this
	example and the settings explored by simulation, and among methods
	readily available to investigators (i.e. sans full data), the MLE
	provided an unbiased and appropriately precise estimate of the exposure-outcome
	OR.},

	randomized clinical trials. Relative time (RT) is a competing measure
	that is rarely used. PURPOSE: We describe a simple area-based nonparametric
	estimator of RT and illustrate its use in the Acyclovir Prevention
	Trial. METHODS: Let Q( x)(p) be the quantile function for the xth
	treatment group, defined as the time by which p% of the treatment
	group experience the event, and p( x) be the maximum event proportion
	observed. Our consistent estimator is defined as the ratio of the
	integrals of Q(1)(p) and Q(0) (p) with integration over 0 to p, where
	p =min(p(1), p( 0)). Confidence limits (CL) are provided by bootstrap.
	RESULTS: A total of 703 immunocompetent adult men and women (54%
	male, 79% Caucasian, median age 49 years) with a history of ocular
	herpes simplex virus (HSV) were enrolled in 1992-1996, randomized
	to acyclovir or placebo, followed for up to 1 year for the 1st episode
	of ocular HSV, and 170 events were confirmed by a study-certified
	ophthalmologist using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The nonparametric
	RT comparing acyclovir use with nonuse was 2.6 (bootstrap 95% CL:
	1.6, 4.2). For comparison, the best-fitting parametric model was
	the lognormal (RT = 2.5; 95% CL: 1.5, 3.9). In limited simulations,
	the average proposed estimate of RT was similar to the true RT with
	a relative root mean squared error of 1.13 compared to a correctly
	specified parametric (lognormal) model. LIMITATIONS: An analytical
	variance estimator for the proposed RT is lacking. Also, more examples
	and more extensive simulations are warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Similar
	to Cox's relative hazard estimator, the proposed RT does not assume
	the data are generated from a particular distribution. RTs should
	be more widely used as a measure of association in clinical trials.},

	controlled trials are considered to be evidence of the highest grade,
	whereas observational studies are viewed as having less validity
	because they reportedly overestimate treatment effects. We used published
	meta-analyses to identify randomized clinical trials and observational
	studies that examined the same clinical topics. We then compared
	the results of the original reports according to the type of research
	design. METHODS: A search of the Medline data base for articles published
	in five major medical journals from 1991 to 1995 identified meta-analyses
	of randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of either cohort
	or case-control studies that assessed the same intervention. For
	each of five topics, summary estimates and 95 percent confidence
	intervals were calculated on the basis of data from the individual
	randomized, controlled trials and the individual observational studies.
	RESULTS: For the five clinical topics and 99 reports evaluated, the
	average results of the observational studies were remarkably similar
	to those of the randomized, controlled trials. For example, analysis
	of 13 randomized, controlled trials of the effectiveness of bacille
	Calmette-Guerin vaccine in preventing active tuberculosis yielded
	a relative risk of 0.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to
	0.70) among vaccinated patients, as compared with an odds ratio of
	0.50 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.65) from 10 case-control
	studies. In addition, the range of the point estimates for the effect
	of vaccination was wider for the randomized, controlled trials (0.20
	to 1.56) than for the observational studies (0.17 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS:
	The results of well-designed observational studies (with either a

	South Carolina asbestos textile plant using chrysotile demonstrated
	significant excess mortality due to asbestos-related disease and
	a steep exposure-response relationship for lung cancer. This cohort
	was further studied by adding 15 years of follow-up and including
	mortality among white female and black male workers. Nested case-control
	analyses were undertaken to further explore possible differences
	in lung cancer risk by textile operation as well as possible confounding
	by mineral oil exposures. Preliminary data for white males have been
	previously published. White males experienced statistically significant
	excess mortality due to lung cancer (standardized mortality ratio
	[SMR] = 2.30; confidence interval [CI] = 1.88-2.79), all causes (SMR
	= 1.48; CI = 1.38-158), all cancers (SMR = 1.50; CI = 1.29-1.72),
	diabetes mellitus (SMR = 2.05; CI = 1.18-3.33), heart disease (SMR
	= 1.41; CI = 1.26-1.58), cerebrovascular disease (SMR = 1.50; CI

	= 4.10; CI = 3.10-5.31), and accidents (SMR = 1.49; CI = 1.15-1.91).
	Among white females, statistically significant excesses occurred
	for lung cancer (SMR = 2.75; CI = 2.06-3.61), all causes (SMR = 1.21;
	CI = 1.11-1.32), pneumoconiosis and other respiratory diseases (SMR
	= 2.40; CI = 1.53-3.60), and other respiratory cancers (SMR = 14.98;
	CI = 4.08-38.7). Among the total cohort of black males, the only
	statistically significant excess observed was for pneumoconiosis
	(SMR = 2.19; CI = 1.23-3.62). Based on historical exposure measurements
	at the plant, there was a positive exposure-response relationship
	for both lung cancer and pneumoconiosis. Data for the entire cohort
	demonstrate an increase in the lung cancer relative risk of 2-3%
	for each fiber/cc-year of cumulative chrysotile exposure. This relationship
	was more consistent for the white male workers. The excess risk for
	lung cancer among white males and females appeared to occur at cumulative
	exposures lower than those for black males. Possible reasons for
	the lesser lung cancer risk among black males include less smoking
	and differences in airborne fiber characteristics experienced by
	black males as a result of plant job placement patterns. The case-control
	analysis found employment in preparation and carding operations (where
	most of the black males worked) to be associated with a slightly
	reduced lung cancer risk, although not statistically significant,
	whereas spinning and twisting employment was associated with a statistically
	significant increased lung cancer risk compared to other plant operations.(ABSTRACT

@article{Draper1995,
	abstract = {In most examples of inference and prediction, the expression of uncertainty
	about unknown quantities y on the basis of known quantities x is
	based on a model M that formalizes assumptions about how x and y
	are related. M will typically have two parts: structural assumptions
	S, such as the form of the link function and the choice of error
	distribution in a generalized linear model, and parameters theta
	whose meaning is specific to a given choice of S. It is common in
	statistical theory and practice to acknowledge parametric uncertainty
	about theta given a particular assumed structure S; it is less common
	to acknowledge structural uncertainty about S itself. A widely used
	approach involves enlisting the aid of x to specify a plausible single
	'best' choice S* for S, and then proceeding as if S* were known to
	be correct. In general this approach fails to assess and propagate
	structural uncertainty fully and may lead to miscalibrated uncertainty
	assessment about y given x. When miscalibration occurs it will often
	result in understatement of inferential or predictive uncertainty
	about y, leading to inaccurate scientific summaries and overconfident
	decisions that do not incorporate sufficient hedging against uncertainty.
	In this paper I discuss a Bayesian approach to solving this problem
	that has long been available in principle but is only now becoming
	routinely feasible, by virtue of recent computational advances, and
	examine its implementation in examples that involve forecasting the
	price of oil and estimating the chance of catastrophic failure of

The traditional variance approximation is \$1/$\backslash$mathscr\J\\_$\backslash$hat$\backslash$theta\$ , where \$$\backslash$hat$\backslash$theta\$ is the maximum likelihood estimator and J??is the expected total Fisher information. Many writers, including R. A. Fisher, have argued in favour of the variance estimate 1/I(x), where I(x) is the observed information, i.e. minus the second derivative of the log likelihood function at \$$\backslash$hat$\backslash$theta\$ given data x. We give a frequentist justification for preferring 1/I(x) to \$1/$\backslash$mathscr\J\\_$\backslash$hat$\backslash$theta\$ . The former is shown to approximate the conditional variance of \$$\backslash$hat$\backslash$theta\$ given an appropriate ancillary statistic which to a first approximation is I(x). The theory may be seen to flow naturally from Fisher's pioneering papers on likelihood estimation. A large number of examples are used to supplement a small amount of theory. Our evidence indicates preference for the likelihood ratio method of obtaining confidence limits.},

	because their mortality rates are lower than those of the national

	In a further analysis of data collected in a study of all men ever
	exposed to vinyl chloride monomer in the manufacture of polyvinyl
	chloride in Great Britain, three factors have been shown to contribute
	to the low mortality rates that were observed. The three factors:
	the selection of a healthy population for employment, the survival
	in the industry of the healthier men, and the length of time that
	this population has been pursued, have been quantified. The mortality
	experience within five years of entering this industry was shown
	to be as low as 37% of that expected; for circulatory disease and
	respiratory disease it was as low as 21%. There was a progressive
	increase in standardized mortality ratio with the length of time
	since entry so that the effect had almost disappeared 15 years after
	entry. To avoid confounding the selection effect with the survival
	effect the latter was measured by separating men who survived 15
	years after entering the industry according to whether or not they
	were still in the industry after this period. Those who had left
	experienced an overall standardized mortality ratio some 50% higher

	abstract = {Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted
	for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard
	methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose
	a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment
	variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification.
	Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable
	is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential
	values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments
	being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal
	stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not
	affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as
	any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the
	central property of our principal effects is that they are always
	causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard
	posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal
	causal effects are the link between three recent applications with
	adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance,
	(ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance,
	and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate
	or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects,
	that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true,
	do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects
	of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on
	principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their

	In this paper, the authors examine the consequences of baseline adjustment,

	attainment on change in cognitive function in old age. With data
	from the US-based Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old
	survey (n = 5,726; born before 1924), they show that adjustment for
	baseline cognitive test score substantially inflates regression coefficient
	estimates for the effect of schooling on change in cognitive test
	scores compared with models without baseline adjustment. To explain
	this finding, they consider various plausible assumptions about relations
	among variables. Each set of assumptions is represented by a causal
	diagram. The authors apply simple rules for assessing causal diagrams
	to demonstrate that, in many plausible situations, baseline adjustment
	induces a spurious statistical association between education and
	change in cognitive score. More generally, when exposures are associated
	with baseline health status, this bias can arise if change in health
	status preceded baseline assessment or if the dependent variable

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, Rubin has promoted a model for causal inference based
	on the potential outcomes if individuals received each of the treatments
	under study. Commonly, the assumption is made that the outcome in
	one individual is independent of the treatment assignment and outcome
	in other individuals. In infectious diseases, however, whether one
	person becomes infected is quite often dependent on the infection
	outcome in other individuals, a situation known as dependent happenings.
	Here, we review the model proposed by Rubin for the example of infectious
	disease. Consequences of the violation of the stability assumption
	include the need for an expanded representation of outcomes, and
	the existence of different kinds of effects, such as direct and indirect
	effects. Effects of interest include changes in susceptibility as
	well as changes in infectiousness. We define the transmission probability
	formally as an average causal parameter of effect in a population
	by conditioning on exposure to infection. Unconditional indirect
	and total effects are difficult to define formally using this model
	for causal inference. The assignment mechanism can influence the
	sampling mechanism when it determines who is exposed to infection,

We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form \#8721; \#946;$<$sub$>$jX$<$/sub$>$$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$ by a sum of smooth functions \#8721; s$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$(X$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$). The s$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$()'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor \#951; = \#931; \#946;$<$sub$>$jX$<$/sub$>$$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$ is replaced by the additive predictor \#931; s$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$(X$<$sub$>$j$<$/sub$>$); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.</p>},

	had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. Methods:
	Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated
	the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized
	trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of
	"trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or
	noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. Results: The ITT hazard
	ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus
	noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92-2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96
	(0.78-1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61-1.14)
	in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84-1.48) in the
	others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are
	similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the
	ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated
	adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The
	HRs were 1.61 (0.97-2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66-1.49)

	value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between
	these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates.
	Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between

	misspecification, standard methods for estimating the causal effect
	of time-varying treatments on survival are biased when (i) there
	exists a time-dependent risk factor for survival that also predicts
	subsequent treatment and (ii) past treatment history predicts subsequent
	risk factor level. In contrast, structural models provide consistent
	estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model
	misspecification are absent. The parameters of nested structural

@article{Hubbard2010,
	abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations
	between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health
	outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random
	effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation.
	Population average models typically use a generalized estimating
	equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic
	regression approaches because the health of residents in the same
	neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions
	made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly
	relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the
	literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical
	guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper,
	we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided
	by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression
	models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations
	of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed
	models involve unverifiable assumptions on the data-generating distribution,
	which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference.
	We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average
	models provides a more useful approximation of the truth., (C) 2010

	of no interference between individuals (or units); that is, the potential
	outcomes of one individual are assumed to be unaffected by the treatment
	assignment of other individuals. However, in many settings, this
	assumption obviously does not hold. For example, in the dependent

	depends on who else in the population is vaccinated. In this article,
	we consider a population of groups of individuals where interference

	estimands for direct, indirect, total, and overall causal effects
	of treatment strategies in this setting. Relations among the estimands
	are established; for example, the total causal effect is shown to
	equal the sum of direct and indirect causal effects. Using an experimental
	design with a two-stage randomization procedure (first at the group
	level, then at the individual level within groups), unbiased estimators
	of the proposed estimands are presented. Variances of the estimators

	abstract = {CONTEXT: There is substantial debate about whether the results of
	nonrandomized studies are consistent with the results of randomized
	controlled trials on the same topic. OBJECTIVES: To compare results
	of randomized and nonrandomized studies that evaluated medical interventions
	and to examine characteristics that may explain discrepancies between
	randomized and nonrandomized studies. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-March
	2000), the Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2000), and major journals were
	searched. STUDY SELECTION: Forty-five diverse topics were identified
	for which both randomized trials (n = 240) and nonrandomized studies
	(n = 168) had been performed and had been considered in meta-analyses
	of binary outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on events per patient in
	each study arm and design and characteristics of each study considered
	in each meta-analysis were extracted and synthesized separately for
	randomized and nonrandomized studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Very good correlation
	was observed between the summary odds ratios of randomized and nonrandomized
	studies (r = 0.75; P<.001); however, nonrandomized studies tended
	to show larger treatment effects (28 vs 11; P =.009). Between-study
	heterogeneity was frequent among randomized trials alone (23%) and
	very frequent among nonrandomized studies alone (41%). The summary
	results of the 2 types of designs differed beyond chance in 7 cases
	(16%). Discrepancies beyond chance were less common when only prospective
	studies were considered (8%). Occasional differences in sample size
	and timing of publication were also noted between discrepant randomized
	and nonrandomized studies. In 28 cases (62%), the natural logarithm
	of the odds ratio differed by at least 50%, and in 15 cases (33%),
	the odds ratio varied at least 2-fold between nonrandomized studies
	and randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Despite good correlation between
	randomized trials and nonrandomized studies-in particular, prospective
	studies-discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated
	magnitude of treatment effect are very common.},

	comment = {Balanced repeated replications (BRR) is a general method for computing standard errors. It is useful when mathematical distribution theory is impractical or lacking, and especially for analytical statistics based on complex samples where clustering destroys the independence of observations. Presented are results of methods used to measure standard errors of regression coefficients for several multivariate techniques. The basic designs of the several samples comprised two primary selections (PS) per stratum. Each replication was a half-sample, created by selecting one PS from each stratum. The variance of the coefficient b??, estimated from the entire sample, is measured by (b$_j$ - b??)$^2$, where b$_j$ is the same estimator based on a half-sample. To increase the precision of the variance estimate, select k repeated replications and obtain the mean of the k computed variances, ???(b$_j$ - b??)$^2$/k. Balanced repeated replications reduce the number of repetitions needed; e.g., 48 balanced replications sufficed for 47 strata in our samples. Though proofs are complete only for linear statistics, rationale and results are offered to indicate that BRR provides needed estimates of errors for nonlinear statistics. The ratios, <tex-math>\$$\backslash$sqrt\deff\\$</tex-math>, of actual standard errors to those of simple random sampling, (srs), are investigated for several statistics in five empirical studies. In each study the average values of <tex-math>\$$\backslash$sqrt\deff\\$</tex-math> exceed 1.00 and range from 1.05 for less clustered to 1.46 for more clustered samples.},

	typically follow prospective cohort designs, and enroll large numbers

	years). Using data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS),
	a six-year natural history study that enrolled 871 HIV-infected women
	starting in 1993, we investigate the therapeutic effect of highly

	can be confounded by variables that are time-varying. Our analysis
	uses CD4 data on all follow-up visits over a two-year period, and

These powerful research techniques are surprisingly useful for developing methods of statistical reference for complex models and in understanding the properties of such methods. The targeted audience includes statisticians, biostatisticians, and other researchers with a background in mathematical statistics who have an interest in learning about and doing research in empirical processes and semiparametric inference but who would like to have a friendly and gradual introduction to the area. The book can be used either as a research reference or as a textbook. The level of the book is suitable for a second year graduate course in statistics or biostatistics, provided the students have had a year of graduate level mathematical statistics and a semester of provability."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Competing events can preclude the event of interest from occurring
	in epidemiologic data and can be analyzed by using extensions of
	survival analysis methods. In this paper, the authors outline 3 regression
	approaches for estimating 2 key quantities in competing risks analysis:
	the cause-specific relative hazard (csRH) and the subdistribution
	relative hazard (sdRH). They compare and contrast the structure of
	the risk sets and the interpretation of parameters obtained with
	these methods. They also demonstrate the use of these methods with
	data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study established in 1993,
	treating time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy
	or to clinical disease progression as competing events. In our example,
	women with an injection drug use history were less likely than those
	without a history of injection drug use to initiate therapy prior
	to progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or death by
	both measures of association (csRH = 0.67, 95% confidence interval:
	0.57, 0.80 and sdRH = 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 0.71).
	Moreover, the relative hazards for disease progression prior to treatment

@article{Lenters2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asbestos is a well-recognized cause of lung cancer, but
	there is considerable between-study heterogeneity in the slope of
	the exposure-response relationship. OBJECTIVE: We considered the
	role of quality of the exposure assessment to potentially explain
	heterogeneity in exposure-response slope estimates. DATA SOURCES:
	We searched PubMed MEDLINE (1950-2009) for studies with quantitative
	estimates of cumulative asbestos exposure and lung cancer mortality
	and identified 19 original epidemiological studies. One was a population-based
	case-control study, and the others were industry-based cohort studies.
	DATA EXTRACTION: Cumulative exposure categories and corresponding
	risks were abstracted. Exposure-response slopes [KL (lung cancer
	potency factor of asbestos)] were calculated using linear relative
	risk regression models. DATA SYNTHESIS: We assessed the quality of
	five exposure assessment aspects of each study and conducted random
	effects univariate and multivariate meta-regressions. Heterogeneity
	in exposure-response relationships was greater than expected by chance
	(I2 = 64%). Stratification by exposure assessment characteristics
	revealed that studies with well-documented exposure assessment, larger
	contrast in exposure, greater coverage of the exposure history by
	exposure measurement data, and more complete job histories had higher
	meta-KL values than did studies without these characteristics. The
	latter two covariates were most strongly associated with the KL value.
	Meta-KL values increased when we incrementally restricted analyses
	to higher-quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates
	that studies with higher-quality asbestos exposure assessment yield
	higher meta-estimates of the lung cancer risk per unit of exposure.
	Potency differences for predominantly chrysotile versus amphibole
	asbestos-exposed cohorts become difficult to ascertain when meta-analyses
	are restricted to studies with fewer exposure assessment limitations.},

	emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences,
	the languages used in formulating those assumptions, and the conditional
	nature of causal claims inferred from nonexperimental studies. These
	emphases are illustrated through a brief survey of recent results,

	social characteristics on health has increased in recent years, but
	to date the existing evidence has not been systematically reviewed.
	Multilevel or contextual analyses of social factors and health represent
	a possible reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological paradigms[---]individual
	risk factor epidemiology and an ecological approach. DATA SOURCES[---]Keyword
	searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional references from
	retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION[---]All original studies of the
	effect of local area social characteristics on individual health
	outcomes, adjusted for individual socioeconomic status, published
	in English before 1 June 1998 and focused on populations in developed
	countries. DATA SYNTHESIS[---]The methodological challenges posed
	by the design and interpretation of multilevel studies of local area
	effects are discussed and results summarised with reference to type
	of health outcome. All but two of the 25 reviewed studies reported
	a statistically significant association between at least one measure
	of social environment and a health outcome (contextual effect), after
	adjusting for individual level socioeconomic status (compositional
	effect). Contextual effects were generally modest and much smaller
	than compositional effects. CONCLUSIONS[---]The evidence for modest
	neighbourhood effects on health is fairly consistent despite heterogeneity
	of study designs, substitution of local area measures for neighbourhood
	measures and probable measurement error. By drawing public health
	attention to the health risks associated with the social structure
	and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community
	level interventions may ensue.},

@article{Platt2009,
	abstract = {According to the authors, time-modified confounding occurs when the
	causal relation between a time-fixed or time-varying confounder and
	the treatment or outcome changes over time. A key difference between
	previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified
	confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding
	variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the
	confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the
	authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding
	when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified
	over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when
	time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model
	with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account
	for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with
	appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account
	for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of
	the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation
	over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal
	structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment
	or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be

As evidenced by many spirited discussions over the past few years, the best way of constructing these intervals has not been resolved. In particular, empirical studies have shown that many of these intervals have disappointing finite sample coverage probabilities. The purpose of this article is to show that intervals based on percentiles of the bootstrap distribution have bounds on their finite sample coverage probabilities. Depending on the functional of interest and the distribution of the data, these bounds can be quite low. We argue that these bounds are valid even for methods that are asymptotically second-order accurate. These results are useful to researchers who are contemplating using this type of confidence interval when the sample size is small. These bounds are computed for several examples including the moments and quantiles of several distributions.},

	abstract = {Quantitation of exposure to tobacco products is useful for any individual

	to pathology, or which are concerned with the efficacy of smoking
	cessation methods. The medical history, trying to quantitate the
	current mean daily cigarette consumption (consumption rate), the
	cumulative risk (pack years) and the various types of smoking, including
	inhalation habits, should also be attempted. However, due to the
	quasi-systematic underrating of tobacco consumption which smokers
	have revealed on many occasions, together with difficulty in correctly
	observing cigarette smoking, objective validation of recent historical
	data by quantitative measurement of tobacco products in tissue fluids
	is mandatory. Measurements of nicotine and cotinine levels in serum
	and urine require elaborate and expensive methods, and are not adequate
	for validation of smoking cessation in smokers who are using nicotine
	chewing gum. Carbon monoxide is a good marker of smoke inhalation.
	Normal carboxyhaemoglobin levels allow us to confirm that a subject
	has recently stopped smoking, as its half-life is only a few hours
	in blood. Salivary (or plasma) measurements of thiocyanate discriminate
	between smokers and ex-smokers, with a high probability, particularly
	in those who have stopped smoking for at least 14 days, separating

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of
	exposure to the agent under study, independent risk factors for death
	commonly determine subsequent exposure to the study agent. For example,
	in occupational mortality studies, date of termination of employment
	is both a determinant of subsequent exposure to the chemical agent
	under study (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure)
	and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals
	tend to leave employment). When a risk factor determines subsequent
	exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses
	that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative
	exposure can underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality,
	whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This
	observation raises the question, "Which, if any, empirical population
	parameter can be causally interpreted as the true effect of exposure
	in observational mortality studies?" In answer, we offer a graphical
	approach to the identification and estimation of causal parameters
	in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. We reanalyze
	the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter
	workers using our approach and compare our results with those obtained
	using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure
	on all cause and lung cancer mortality, which standard methods failed
	to detect. The analytic approach introduced in this paper may be
	necessary to control bias in any epidemiologic study in which there
	exists a risk factor which both determines subsequent exposure and
	is determined by previous exposure to the agent under study.},

	abstract = {Suppose, in contrast to the fact, in 1950, we had put the cohort of
	18-year-old non-smoking American men on a stringent mandatory diet
	that guaranteed that no one would ever weigh more than their baseline
	weight established at the age of 18 years. How would the counterfactual
	mortality of these 18 year olds have compared to their actual observed
	mortality through 2007? We describe in detail how this counterfactual
	contrast could be estimated from longitudinal epidemiologic data
	similar to that stored in the electronic medical records of a large
	health maintenance organization (HMO) by applying g-estimation to
	a novel of structural nested model (SNM). Our analytic approach differs
	from any alternative approach in that, in the absence of model misspecification,
	it can successfully adjust for (i) measured time-varying confounders
	such as exercise, hypertension and diabetes that are simultaneously
	intermediate variables on the causal pathway from weight gain to
	death and determinants of future weight gain, (ii) unmeasured confounding
	by undiagnosed preclinical disease (that is, reverse causation) that
	can cause both poor weight gain and premature mortality (provided
	an upper bound can be specified for the maximum length of time a
	subject may suffer from a subclinical illness severe enough to affect
	his weight without the illness becomes clinically manifest) and (iii)
	the presence of particular identifiable subgroups, such as those
	suffering from serious renal, liver, pulmonary and/or cardiac disease,
	in whom confounding by unmeasured prognostic factors is so severe
	as to render useless any attempt at direct analytic adjustment. However,
	(ii) and (iii) limit the ability to empirically test whether the
	SNM is misspecified. The other two g-methods--the parametric g-computation
	algorithm and inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation

@article{Robins1992c,
	abstract = {In order to estimate the causal effects of one or more exposures or
	treatments on an outcome of interest, one has to account for the
	effect of "confounding factors" which both covary with the exposures
	or treatments and are independent predictors of the outcome. In this
	paper we present regression methods which, in contrast to standard
	methods, adjust for the confounding effect of multiple continuous
	or discrete covariates by modelling the conditional expectation of
	the exposures or treatments given the confounders. In the special
	case of a univariate dichotomous exposure or treatment, this conditional
	expectation is identical to what Rosenbaum and Rubin have called
	the propensity score. They have also proposed methods to estimate
	causal effects by modelling the propensity score. Our methods generalize
	those of Rosenbaum and Rubin in several ways. First, our approach
	straightforwardly allows for multivariate exposures or treatments,
	each of which may be continuous, ordinal, or discrete. Second, even
	in the case of a single dichotomous exposure, our approach does not
	require subclassification or matching on the propensity score so
	that the potential for "residual confounding," i.e., bias, due to
	incomplete matching is avoided. Third, our approach allows a rather
	general formalization of the idea that it is better to use the "estimated
	propensity score" than the true propensity score even when the true
	score is known. The additional power of our approach derives from
	the fact that we assume the causal effects of the exposures or treatments
	can be described by the parametric component of a semiparametric
	regression model. To illustrate our methods, we reanalyze the effect
	of current cigarette smoking on the level of forced expiratory volume
	in one second in a cohort of 2,713 adult white males. We compare
	the results with those obtained using standard methods.},

	to represent smooth relationships between a continuous predictor

	a seriously restricted set of such models is used routinely in practical
	data analysis - typically, linear, quadratic or occasionally cubic
	polynomials, or sometimes a power or logarithmic transformation of
	a covariate. Since their flexibility is limited, it is not surprising
	that the fit of such models is often poor. Royston and Altman's recent
	work on fractional polynomials has extended the range of available
	functions. It is clearly crucial that the chosen final model fits
	the data well. Achieving a good fit with minimal restriction on the
	functional form has been the motivation behind the major recent research
	effort on non-parametric curve-fitting techniques. Here I propose
	that one such model, a (possibly over-fitted) cubic smoothing spline,
	may be used to define a suitable reference curve against which the
	fit of a parametric model may be checked. I suggest a significance
	test for the purpose and examine its type I error and power in a
	small simulation study. Several families of parametric models, including
	some with sigmoid curves, are considered. Their suitability in fitting
	regression relationships found in several real data sets is investigated.
	With all the example data sets, a simple parametric model can be

	and economic sciences. The related terms of 'biomarkers' and 'surrogates'

	this concept is represented by graphical displays of various kinds.
	The view here is that there is a great deal of imprecise discussion
	surrounding this topic and, moreover, that the most straightforward
	way to clarify the situation is by using potential outcomes to define
	causal effects. In particular, I suggest that the use of principal
	stratification is key to understanding the meaning of direct and

@article{Rubin1997,
	abstract = {The aim of many analyses of large databases is to draw causal inferences
	about the effects of actions, treatments, or interventions. Examples
	include the effects of various options available to a physician for
	treating a particular patient, the relative efficacies of various
	health care providers, and the consequences of implementing a new
	national health care policy. A complication of using large databases
	to achieve such aims is that their data are almost always observational
	rather than experimental. That is, the data in most large data sets
	are not based on the results of carefully conducted randomized clinical
	trials, but rather represent data collected through the observation
	of systems as they operate in normal practice without any interventions
	implemented by randomized assignment rules. Such data are relatively
	inexpensive to obtain, however, and often do represent the spectrum
	of medical practice better than the settings of randomized experiments.
	Consequently, it is sensible to try to estimate the effects of treatments
	from such large data sets, even if only to help design a new randomized
	experiment or shed light on the generalizability of results from
	existing randomized experiments. However, standard methods of analysis
	using available statistical software (such as linear or logistic
	regression) can be deceptive for these objectives because they provide
	no warnings about their propriety. Propensity score methods are more
	reliable tools for addressing such objectives because the assumptions
	needed to make their answers appropriate are more assessable and

	serious attention of statisticians. Although there exist recent discussions
	concerning the general definition of causal effects and a substantial
	literature on specific techniques for the analysis of data in randomized
	and nonrandomized studies, there has been relatively little discussion
	of modes of statistical inference for causal effects. This presentation
	briefly describes and contrasts four basic modes of statistical inference
	for causal effects, emphasizes the common underlying causal framework
	with a posited assignment mechanism, and describes practical implications
	in the context of an example involving the effects of switching from
	a name-brand to a generic drug. A fundamental conclusion is that
	in such nonrandomized studies, sensitivity of inference to the assignment
	mechanism is the dominant issue, and it cannot be avoided by changing
	modes of inference, for instance, by changing from randomization-based

	In an experiment, one assignment of treatments is chosen and only

	for causal effects follows from finding the predictive distribution

	makes clear the role of mechanisms that sample experimental units,

	must model them in the data analysis and, consequently, confront
	inferences for causal effects that are sensitive to the specification
	of the prior distribution of the data. Moreover, not all ignorable
	mechanisms can yield data from which inferences for causal effects

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence from toxicological studies indicates that the
	risk of respiratory diseases varies with asbestos fibre length and
	width. However, there is a total lack of epidemiological evidence
	concerning this question. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort
	mortality study of 3072 workers from an asbestos textile plant which
	was recently updated for vital status through 2001. A previously
	developed job exposure matrix based on phase contrast microscopy
	(PCM) was modified to provide fibre size-specific exposure estimates
	using data from a re-analysis of samples by transmission electron
	microscopy (TEM). Cox proportional hazards models were fit using
	alternative exposure metrics for single and multiple combinations
	of fibre length and diameter. RESULTS: TEM-based cumulative exposure
	estimates were found to provide stronger predictions of asbestosis
	and lung cancer mortality than PCM-based estimates. Cumulative exposures
	based on individual fibre size-specific categories were all found
	to be highly statistically significant predictors of lung cancer
	and asbestosis. Both lung cancer and asbestosis were most strongly
	associated with exposure to thin fibres (<0.25 microm). Longer (>10
	microm) fibres were found to be the strongest predictors of lung
	cancer, but an inconsistent pattern with fibre length was observed
	for asbestosis. Cumulative exposures were highly correlated across
	all fibre size categories in this cohort (0.28-0.99, p values <0.001),
	which complicates the interpretation of the study findings. CONCLUSIONS:
	Asbestos fibre dimension appears to be an important determinant of
	respiratory disease risk. Current PCM-based methods may underestimate
	asbestos exposures to the thinnest fibres, which were the strongest
	predictor of lung cancer or asbestosis mortality in this study. Additional
	studies are needed of other asbestos cohorts to further elucidate
	the role of fibre dimension and type.},

	abstract = {Background W S Robinson made a seminal contribution by demonstrating
	that correlations for the same two variables can be different at
	the individual and ecologic level. This study reanalyzes and historically
	situates Robinson's influential study that laid the foundation for
	the primacy of analyzing data at only the individual level.Methods
	We applied a binomial multilevel logistic model to analyse variation
	in illiteracy as enumerated by the 1930 US. Census (the same data
	as used by Robinson). The outcome was log odds of being illiterate,
	while predictors were race/nativity (???{\"A}{\`o}native whites???{\"A}{\^o},
	???{\"A}{\`o}foreign-born whites???{\"A}{\^o} and ???{\"A}{\`o}negroes???{\"A}{\^o})
	at the individual-level, and presence of Jim Crow segregation laws
	for education at the state-level. We conducted historical research
	to identify the social and scientific context within which Robinson's
	study was produced and favourably received.Results Empirically, the
	substantial state variations in illiteracy could not be accounted
	by the states' race/nativity composition. Different approaches to
	modelling state-effects yielded considerably attenuated associations
	at the individual-level between illiteracy and race/nativity. Furthermore,
	state variation in illiteracy was different across the race/nativity
	groups, with state variation being largest for whites and least for
	foreign-born whites. Strong effects of Jim Crow education laws on
	illiteracy were observed with the effect being strongest for blacks.
	Historically, Robinson's study was consonant with the post-World
	War II ascendancy of methodological individualism.Conclusion Applying
	a historically informed multilevel perspective to Robinson's profoundly
	influential study, we demonstrate that meaningful analysis of individual-level
	relationships requires attention to substantial heterogeneity in
	state characteristics. The implication is that perils are posed by
	not only ecological fallacy but also individualistic fallacy. Multilevel
	thinking, grounded in historical and spatiotemporal context, is thus
	a necessity, not an option.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the absence of unmeasured confounding, standard methods
	for estimating the effects of time-varying treatments on an event
	are biased when a time-dependent risk factor for the event also predicts
	subsequent treatments and when past treatment history predicts subsequent
	risk factor levels. In contrast, structural models provide unbiased
	estimates of effects when unmeasured confounding is absent. METHODS:
	We describe a multiplicative structural mean model and use it to
	estimate the effects of time-varying osteoporosis treatments on incidence
	of fractures among 1328 postmenopausal women over 40 years of age
	in a hospital-based cohort study in Japan. The parameters of the
	structural mean model are estimated by g-estimation. RESULTS: The
	number of vertebral fractures and bone mineral density levels predicted
	the selection of subsequent treatments and were affected by the previous
	treatments. Incidence rate ratios of bisphosphonates, active vitamin
	D3, and conjugated estrogen compared with no drug therapy were 0.58
	(95% confidence interval = 0.44-0.77), 0.82 (0.48-1.38), and 0.60
	(0.47-0.76), respectively, after adjusting time-dependent confounders.
	For initial treatments estimated by the standard Poisson-GEE, incidence
	rate ratios were 1.61 (1.23-2.10), 1.16 (0.96-1.40), and 0.73 (0.52-1.02),
	respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis using the structural mean
	model showed that bisphosphonates, active vitamin D3, and conjugated
	estrogen all had preventive effects on the incidence of fractures
	by appropriate adjustments for time-dependent confounders. The results
	from standard Poisson-GEE analysis were the opposite of these results
	and of evidence from randomized trials. We consider our methods useful

	abstract = {We consider a regression model where the error term is assumed to follow a type of asymmetric Laplace distribution. We explore its use in the estimation of conditional quantiles of a continuous outcome variable given a set of covariates in the presence of random censoring. Censoring may depend on covariates. Estimation of the regression coefficients is carried out by maximizing a non-differentiable likelihood function. In the scenarios considered in a simulation study, the Laplace estimator showed correct coverage and shorter computation time than the alternative methods considered, some of which occasionally failed to converge. We illustrate the use of Laplace regression with an application to survival time in patients with small cell lung cancer.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, with a variety of contributing causes and risk factors. Environmental exposures represent a group of understudied, but potentially important, factors. Phthalate diesters are used extensively in a variety of consumer products worldwide. Consequently, exposure in pregnant women is highly prevalent. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Women were recruited for a prospective observational cohort study from 2006-2008. Each provided demographic data, biological samples, and information about birth outcomes. From within this group, we selected 130 cases of preterm birth and 352 randomly assigned control participants, and we analyzed urine samples from up to 3 time points during pregnancy for levels of phthalate metabolites. EXPOSURE: Phthalate exposure during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined associations between average levels of phthalate exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth, defined as fewer than 37 weeks of completed gestation, as well as spontaneous preterm birth, defined as preterm preceded by spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes (n = 57). RESULTS: Geometric means of the di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), as well as mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), were significantly higher in cases compared with control participants. In adjusted models, MEHP, MECPP, and Sigma DEHP metabolites were associated with significantly increased odds of preterm birth. When spontaneous preterm births were examined alone, MEHP, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, MECPP, Sigma DEHP, MBP, and mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate metabolite levels were all associated with significantly elevated odds of prematurity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women exposed to phthalates during pregnancy have significantly increased odds of delivering preterm. Steps should be taken to decrease maternal exposure to phthalates during pregnancy.},

@article{Goodman1999,
	abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

STUDY DESIGN: Studies investigating ethnicity (or race) as a risk factor for PTB were included if performing adjustments for confounders. A meta-analysis was performed, and data were synthesized using a random effects model. RESULTS: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Black ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of PTB when compared with whites (range of adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 0.6 to 2.8, pooled OR 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 2.2). For Asian ethnicity, there was no significant association (range of adjusted ORs 0.6 to 2.3). For Hispanic ethnicity, there also was no significant association (range of adjusted ORs 0.7 to 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic disparities in the risk of PTB were clearly pronounced among black women. Future research should focus on preventative strategies for ethnic groups at high risk for PTB. Information on ethnic disparities in risk of PTB-related neonatal morbidity and mortality is lacking and is also a topic of interest for future research.},

Capturing the excitement of the new field of "whiteness studies" and linking it to traditional historical inquiry. Jacobson shows that in this nation of immigrants "race" has been at the core of civic assimilation: ethnic minorities in becoming American were reracialized to become Caucasian. He provides a counterhistory of how nationality groups such as the Irish or Greeks became Americans as racial groups like Celts or Mediterraneans became Caucasian.

Next, using recent human genetic clustering results, I show that this set of human population groups is a partition of human populations that I call `the Blumenbach partition'.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews 138 empirical quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism and health. These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health.},

The eight different questionnaires were administered to random subsamples of six "targeted" populations: geographic areas with ethnic concentrations of whites, blacks, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. The major conclusion is that allowing multiple responses to the "race" question in the 2000 census (and other variations in measurement that were considered in RAETT) had only a slight impact on the measured racial composition of the population. Another finding was a dramatic reduction in nonresponse to the combined race/Hispanic-origin question relative to all other questionnaire formats. We conclude that the concept of "origins" may be closer to the popular understanding of American diversity than is the antiquated concept of race.},

	abstract = {This is a comprehensive narrative review of the literature on the current science and evidence of population-level differences in risk factors for heart disease among different racial and ethnic population in the United States (U.S.). It begins by discussing the importance of population-level risk assessment of heart disease in light of the growth rate of specific minority populations in the U.S. It describes the population-level dynamics for racial and ethnic minorities: a higher overall prevalence of risk factors for coronary artery disease that are unrecognized and therefore not treated, which increases their likelihood of experiencing adverse outcome and, therefore, potentially higher morbidity and mortality. It discusses the rate of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in minority communities. Minority patients with ACS are at greater risk of myocardial infarction (MI), rehospitalization, and death from ACS. They also are less likely than non-minority patients to receive potentially beneficial treatments such as angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. This paper looks at the data surrounding the increased rate of heart disease in racial and ethnic minorities, where the risk is related to the prevalence of comorbidities with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, which, in combination with environmental factors, may largely explain CHF disparity. The conclusion is that it is essential that healthcare providers understand these various communities, including nuances in disease presentation, risk factors, and treatment among different racial and ethnic groups. Awareness of these communities' attributes, as well as differences in incidence, risk factor burdens, prognosis and treatment are necessary to mitigate racial and ethnic disparities in heart disease.},

In such settings, the odds ratio will be farther from the null than the risk ratio. Direct and unbiased estimates of the risk ratio may be obtained from a log binomial model fit by maximum likelihood. When the maximum likelihood log binomial model fails to converge (as is common) or provides predicted probability estimates or upper confidence limits greater than 1.0, various approaches have been suggested, but each has drawbacks, as we describe. We propose a novel Bayesian approach for the estimation of the risk ratio from the log binomial model that addresses drawbacks of existing approaches. Posterior computation can be accomplished easily using the WinBUGs code provided.},

In this paper, the author presents a simple and efficient two-stage approach to estimate the risk ratios directly, which does not directly rely on consistency for an estimate of the baseline risk. This latter property is a key advantage of the approach over existing methods, because, unlike these other methods, the proposed approach obviates the need to restrict the predicted risk probabilities to fall below one, in order to recover efficient inferences about risk ratios. An additional appeal of the approach is that it is easy to implement. Finally, when the primary interest is in the effect of a specific binary exposure, a simple doubly robust closed-form estimator is derived, for the multiplicative effect of the exposure. Specifically, we show how one can adjust for confounding by incorporating a working regression model for the propensity score so that the correct inferences about the multiplicative effect of the exposure are recovered if either this model is correct or a working model for the association between confounders and outcome risk is correct, but both do not necessarily hold.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for preterm delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Selection criteria were (1). the data appeared in original, published English-language reports of prospective studies or control groups of clinical trials that included women at <37 weeks of gestation with intact amniotic membranes, (2). all the women had to have been screened for bacterial vaginosis that was diagnosed by either clinical criteria or criteria that were based on Gram stain findings, and (3). the outcomes were preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, maternal or neonatal infection, and perinatal death. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with results for 20,232 patients were included. Bacterial vaginosis increased the risk of preterm delivery >2-fold (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54-3.12). Higher risks were calculated for subgroups of studies that screened for bacterial vaginosis at <16 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 7.55; 95% CI, 1.80-31.65) or at <20 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 2.11-8.39). Bacterial vaginosis also significantly increased the risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio, 9.91; 95% CI, 1.99-49.34) and maternal infection (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.26-5.08). No significant results were calculated for the outcome of neonatal infection or perinatal death. CONCLUSION: Bacterial vaginosis, early in pregnancy, is a strong risk factor for preterm delivery and spontaneous abortion.},

@article{Kenyon2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Premature birth carries substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Subclinical infection is associated with preterm rupture of membranes (PROM). Prophylactic maternal antibiotic therapy might lessen infectious morbidity and delay labour, but could suppress labour without treating underlying infection. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of administering antibiotics to women with PROM before 37 weeks, on maternal infectious morbidity, neonatal morbidity and mortality, and longer-term childhood development. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing antibiotic administration with placebo that reported clinically relevant outcomes were included as were trials of different antibiotics. Trials in which no placebo was used were included for the outcome of perinatal death alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data from each report without blinding of either the results or the treatments that women received. We sought unpublished data from a number of authors. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 trials, involving 6872 women and babies.The use of antibiotics following PROM is associated with statistically significant reductions in chorioamnionitis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.96, and a reduction in the numbers of babies born within 48 hours (average RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.87) and seven days of randomisation (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89). The following markers of neonatal morbidity were reduced: neonatal infection (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85), use of surfactant (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96), oxygen therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96), and abnormal cerebral ultrasound scan prior to discharge from hospital (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98). Co-amoxiclav was associated with an increased risk of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.57 to 14.23).One study evaluated the children's health at seven years of age (ORACLE Children Study) and found antibiotics seemed to have little effect on the health of children. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Routine prescription of antibiotics for women with preterm rupture of the membranes is associated with prolongation of pregnancy and improvements in a number of short-term neonatal morbidities, but no significant reduction in perinatal mortality. Despite lack of evidence of longer-term benefit in childhood, the advantages on short-term morbidities are such that we would recommend antibiotics are routinely prescribed. The antibiotic of choice is not clear but co-amoxiclav should be avoided in women due to increased risk of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes and, in particular, preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2012), searched cited references from retrieved articles and reviewed abstracts, letters to the editor and editorials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora whether symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected through screening. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4403 women; random-effects, T(2) = 0.19, I(2) = 91%). Antibiotic treatment also reduced the risk of late miscarriage (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials, 1270 women, fixed-effect, I(2) = 0%).Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women; random-effects, T(2) = 0.06, I(2) = 48%), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials, 493 women). It did increase the risk of side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2323 women, fixed-effect, I(2) = 0%).In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; five trials, 4088 women; random-effects, T(2) = 0.06, I(2) = 49%).In women with a previous PTB, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent PTB (average RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.48; three trials, 421 women; random-effects, T(2) = 0.19, I(2) = 72%).In women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84; two trials, 894 women).One small trial of 156 women compared metronidazole and clindamycin, both oral and vaginal, with no significant differences seen for any of the pre-specified primary outcomes. Statistically significant differences were seen for the outcomes of prolongation of gestational age (days) (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.74) and birthweight (grams) (MD 75.18; 95% CI 25.37 to 124.99) however these represent relatively small differences in the clinical setting.Oral antibiotics versus vaginal antibiotics did not reduce the risk of PTB (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.52; two trials, 264 women). Oral antibiotics had some advantage over vaginal antibiotics (whether metronidazole or clindamycin) with respect to admission to neonatal unit (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92, one trial, 156 women), prolongation of gestational age (days) (MD 9.00; 95% CI 8.20 to 9.80; one trial, 156 women) and birthweight (grams) (MD 342.13; 95% CI 293.04 to 391.22; one trial, 156 women).Different frequency of dosing of antibiotics was assessed in one small trial and showed no significant difference for any outcome assessed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. The overall risk of PTB was not significantly reduced. This review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis will prevent PTB and its consequences. When screening criteria were broadened to include women with abnormal flora there was a 47% reduction in preterm birth, however this is limited to two included studies.},

@article{Amsel1983,
	abstract = {Numerous previous studies of nonspecific vaginitis have yielded contradictory results regarding its cause and clinical manifestations, due to a lack of uniform case definition and laboratory methods. We studied 397 consecutive unselected female university students and applied sets of well defined criteria to distinguish nonspecific vaginitis from other forms of vaginitis and from normal findings. Using such criteria, we diagnosed nonspecific vaginitis in up to 25 percent of our study population; asymptomatic disease was recognized in more than 50 percent of those with nonspecific vaginitis. A clinical diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis, based on simple office procedures, was correlated with both the presence and the concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis (Hemophilus vaginalis) in vaginal discharge, and with characteristic biochemical findings in vaginal discharge. Nonspecific vaginitis was also correlated with a history of sexual activity, a history of previous trichomoniasis, current use of nonbarrier contraceptive methods, and, particularly, use of an intrauterine device. G. vaginalis was isolated from 51.3 percent of the total population using a highly selective medium that detected the organism in lower concentration in vaginal discharge than did previously used media. Practical diagnostic criteria for standard clinical use are proposed. Application of such criteria should assist in clinical management of nonspecific vaginitis and in further study of the microbiologic and biochemical correlates and the pathogenesis of this mild but quite prevalent disease.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine intercenter variability in the interpretation of Gram-stained vaginal smears from pregnant women. The intercenter reliability of individual morphotypes identified on the vaginal smear was evaluated by comparing them with those obtained at a standard center. A new scoring system that uses the most reliable morphotypes from the vaginal smear was proposed for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. This scoring system was compared with the Spiegel criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system (0 to 10) was described as a weighted combination of the following morphotypes: lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis or bacteroides (small gram-variable rods or gram-negative rods), and curved gram-variable rods. By using the Spearman rank correlation to determine intercenter variability, gram-positive cocci had poor agreement (0.23); lactobacilli (0.65), G. vaginalis (0.69), and bacteroides (0.57) had moderate agreement; and small (0.74) and curved (0.85) gram-variable rods had good agreement. The reliability of the 0 to 10 scoring system was maximized by not using gram-positive cocci, combining G. vaginalis and bacteroides morphotypes, and weighting more heavily curved gram-variable rods. For comparison with the Spiegel criteria, a score of 7 or higher was considered indicative of bacterial vaginosis. The standardized score had improved intercenter reliability (r = 0.82) compared with the Spiegel criteria (r = 0.61). The standardized score also facilitates future research concerning bacterial vaginosis because it provides gradations of the disturbance of vaginal flora which may be associated with different levels of risk for pregnancy complications.},

	abstract = {We updated a previously published meta-analysis to evaluate bacterial vaginosis (BV) and intermediate vaginal flora as risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome. Selection criteria were original, published, English-language reports of cohort studies or control groups of clinical trials including women <37 weeks' gestation with intact amniotic membranes. All women had to be screened for BV, diagnosed either by clinical criteria or by criteria based on Gram-stain findings. Outcomes were preterm delivery, late miscarriages, maternal or neonatal infections, and perinatal mortality. Fourteen new studies with results for 10,286 patients were included, so that results for 30,518 patients in 32 studies were available for this meta-analysis. BV more than doubled the risk of preterm delivery in asymptomatic patients (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.56-3.00) and in patients with symptoms of preterm labor (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.02-5.58). BV also significantly increased the risk of late miscarriages (OR: 6.32, 95% CI: 3.65-10.94) and maternal infection (OR: 2.53, 95% CI 1.26-5.08) in asymptomatic patients. No significant results were calculated for the outcomes of neonatal infection or perinatal mortality. Also, intermediate vaginal flora was not significantly associated with any outcome included. The results of this meta-analysis confirm that BV is a risk factor for preterm delivery and maternal infectious morbidity and a strong risk factor for late miscarriage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in access to regular health care have been reported in the U.S., but little is known about the extent of disparities in societies with universal coverage. PURPOSE: To investigate the extent of racial disparities in access to care under conditions of universal coverage by observing the association between race and regular access to a doctor in Canada. METHODS: Racial disparities in access to a regular doctor were calculated using the largest available source of nationally representative data in Canada-the Canadian Community Health Survey. Surveys from 2000-2010 were analyzed in 2014. Multinomial regression analyses predicted odds of having a regular doctor for each racial group compared to whites. Analyses were stratified by immigrant status-Canadian-born versus shorter-term immigrant versus longer-term immigrants-and controlled for sociodemographics and self-rated health. RESULTS: Racial disparities in Canada, a country with universal coverage, were far more muted than those previously reported in the U.S. Only among longer-term Latin American immigrants (OR=1.90, 95% CI=1.45, 2.08) and Canadian-born Aboriginals (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.22, 1.47) were significant disparities noted. Among shorter-term immigrants, all Asians were more likely than whites, and among longer-term immigrants, South Asians were more like than whites, to have a regular doctor. CONCLUSIONS: Universal coverage may have a major impact on reducing racial disparities in access to health care, although among some subgroups, other factors may also play a role above and beyond health insurance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and correlates of short interpregnancy intervals in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed pregnancy data from a nationally representative sample of 12,279 women from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. We limited our sample to second and higher-order births within 5 years of the interview. Interpregnancy intervals were calculated as the interval between the delivery date of the preceding live birth and the conception date of the index pregnancy, with short interpregnancy intervals defined as intervals less than 18 months. We used simple and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine associations between short interpregnancy intervals and maternal demographic and childbearing characteristics, including pregnancy intention. RESULTS: Among the 2,253 pregnancies in our sample, one third (35%) were conceived within 18 months of a previous birth. After adjusting for sociodemographic and childbearing characteristics, women were significantly more likely to have a short interpregnancy interval if they were aged 15-19 years or married at the time of conception of the index pregnancy, initiated childbearing after age 30 years, or reported the pregnancy as unintended. Short interpregnancy intervals were more likely to be intended among more advantaged women (married, non-Hispanic white, college-educated, or non-Medicaid delivery). We estimate that preventing unintended pregnancies would reduce the proportion of short interpregnancy intervals from 35% to 23%. CONCLUSION: Providing counseling about the potential negative consequences of short interpregnancy intervals and improving women's contraceptive use to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy likely would reduce the proportion of short interpregnancy interval pregnancies in the United States.

	abstract = {Background: Low serum potassium appears to be independently associated with incident type 2 diabetes, and low dietary potassium is more common in African Americans than in whites.Objective: We hypothesized that low serum potassium contributes to the excess risk of diabetes in African Americans.Design: We analyzed data collected from 1987 to 1996 from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. At baseline, we identified 2716 African American and 9493 white participants without diabetes. We used multivariate Cox models to estimate the relative hazards (RHs) of incident diabetes related to baseline serum potassium during 9 y of follow-up.Results: Mean serum potassium concentrations were lower in African Americans than in whites at baseline (4.2 compared with 4.5 mEq/L; P < 0.01), and African Americans had a greater incidence of diabetes than did whites (26 compared with 13 cases/1000 person-years). The adjusted RHs (95% CI) of incident diabetes for those with serum potassium concentrations of <4.0, 4.0--4.4, and 4.5--4.9 mEq/L, compared with those with serum potassium concentrations of 5.0--5.5 mEq/L (referent), were 2.28 (1.21, 4.28), 1.97 (1.06, 3.65), and 1.85 (0.99, 3.47) for African Americans and 1.53 (1.14, 2.05), 1.49 (1.19, 1.87), and 1.27 (1.02, 1.58) for whites, respectively. Racial differences in serum potassium appeared to explain 18% of the excess risk of diabetes in African Americans, which is comparable with the percentage of risk explained by racial differences in body mass index (22%).Conclusions: Low serum potassium concentrations in African Americans may contribute to their excess risk of type 2 diabetes relative to whites. Whether interventions to increase serum potassium concentrations in African Americans might reduce their excess risk deserves further study.

In this issue of the Journal, Jiang and VanderWeele (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;000(00):000-000) formalize the conditions under which the difference method can be used to estimate natural indirect effects. In this commentary, I discuss implications of the controversial "cross-worlds" independence assumption needed to identify natural effects. I argue that with a binary mediator, a simple modification of the authors' approach will provide bounds for natural direct and indirect effect estimates that better reflect the capacity of the available data to support empirical statements on the presence of mediated effects. I discuss complications encountered when odds ratios are used to decompose effects, as well as the implications of incorrectly assuming the absence of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounders. I note that the former problem can be entirely resolved using collapsible measures of effect, such as risk ratios. In the Appendix, I use previous derivations for natural direct effect bounds on the risk difference scale to provide bounds on the odds ratio scale that accommodate 1) uncertainty due to the cross-world independence assumption and 2) uncertainty due to the cross-world independence assumption and the presence of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounders.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: A 2001 study revealed that $3.6 billion could be saved if breastfeeding rates were increased to levels of the Healthy People objectives. It studied 3 diseases and totaled direct and indirect costs and cost of premature death. The 2001 study can be updated by using current breastfeeding rates and adding additional diseases analyzed in the 2007 breastfeeding report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.Study Design: Using methods similar to those in the 2001 study, we computed current costs and compared them to the projected costs if 80% and 90% of US families could comply with the recommendation to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Excluding type 2 diabetes (because of insufficient data), we conducted a cost analysis for all pediatric diseases for which the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported risk ratios that favored breastfeeding: necrotizing enterocolitis, otitis media, gastroenteritis, hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood asthma, childhood leukemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and childhood obesity. We used 2005 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breastfeeding rates and 2007 dollars.Results: If 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance).Conclusions: Current US breastfeeding rates are suboptimal and result in significant excess costs and preventable infant deaths. Investment in strategies to promote longer breastfeeding duration and exclusivity may be cost-effective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding has clear short-term benefits, but its long-term consequences on human capital are yet to be established. We aimed to assess whether breastfeeding duration was associated with intelligence quotient (IQ), years of schooling, and income at the age of 30 years, in a setting where no strong social patterning of breastfeeding exists. METHODS: A prospective, population-based birth cohort study of neonates was launched in 1982 in Pelotas, Brazil. Information about breastfeeding was recorded in early childhood. At 30 years of age, we studied the IQ (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd version), educational attainment, and income of the participants. For the analyses, we used multiple linear regression with adjustment for ten confounding variables and the G-formula. FINDINGS: From June 4, 2012, to Feb 28, 2013, of the 5914 neonates enrolled, information about IQ and breastfeeding duration was available for 3493 participants. In the crude and adjusted analyses, the durations of total breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding (breastfeeding as the main form of nutrition with some other foods) were positively associated with IQ, educational attainment, and income. We identified dose-response associations with breastfeeding duration for IQ and educational attainment. In the confounder-adjusted analysis, participants who were breastfed for 12 months or more had higher IQ scores (difference of 3.76 points, 95% CI 2.20-5.33), more years of education (0.91 years, 0.42-1.40), and higher monthly incomes (341.0 Brazilian reals, 93.8-588.3) than did those who were breastfed for less than 1 month. The results of our mediation analysis suggested that IQ was responsible for 72% of the effect on income. INTERPRETATION: Breastfeeding is associated with improved performance in intelligence tests 30 years later, and might have an important effect in real life, by increasing educational attainment and income in adulthood.

@article{Marshall2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Power for assessing interactions during data analysis is often poor in epidemiologic studies. This is because epidemiologic studies are frequently powered primarily to assess main effects only. In light of this, some investigators raise the Type I error rate, thereby increasing power, when testing interactions. However, this is a poor analysis strategy if the study is chronically under-powered (e.g. in a small study) or already adequately powered (e.g. in a very large study). To demonstrate this point, this study quantified the gain in power for testing interactions when the Type I error rate is raised, for a variety of study sizes and types of interaction. METHODS: Power was computed for the Wald test for interaction, the likelihood ratio test for interaction, and the Breslow-Day test for heterogeneity of the odds ratio. Ten types of interaction, ranging from sub-additive through to super-multiplicative, were investigated in the simple scenario of two binary risk factors. Case-control studies of various sizes were investigated (75 cases & 150 controls, 300 cases & 600 controls, and 1200 cases & 2400 controls). RESULTS: The strategy of raising the Type I error rate from 5% to 20% resulted in a useful power gain (a gain of at least 10%, resulting in power of at least 70%) in only 7 of the 27 interaction type/study size scenarios studied (26%). In the other 20 scenarios, power was either already adequate (n = 8; 30%), or else so low that it was still weak (below 70%) even after raising the Type I error rate to 20% (n = 12; 44%). CONCLUSION: Relaxing the Type I error rate did not usefully improve the power for tests of interaction in many of the scenarios studied. In many studies, the small power gains obtained by raising the Type I error will be more than offset by the disadvantage of increased "false positives". I recommend investigators should not routinely raise the Type I error rate when assessing tests of interaction.},

We have explored whether, and to what extent, these differences would be relevant regarding age at initiation of CRC screening. Using population-based cancer registry data from the US and national mortality statistics from different countries, we looked at cumulative 10-year incidence and mortality of CRC reached among men at ages 50, 55, and 60, and found that women mainly reached equivalent levels when 4 to 8 years older. The gender differences were remarkably constant across populations and over time. These patterns suggest that gender differentiation of age at initiation may be worthwhile to utilise CRC-screening resources more efficiently.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regular antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy is accepted practice, and while most women have an increase in the number of antenatal visits, there is no consensus as to what constitutes optimal care. 'Specialised' antenatal clinics have been advocated as a way of improving outcomes for women and their infants. OBJECTIVES: To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of 'specialised' antenatal clinics compared with 'standard' antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 April 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies with a multiple pregnancy who received antenatal care specifically designed for women with a multiple pregnancy (as defined by the trial authors) with outcomes in controls who received 'standard' antenatal care (as defined by the trial authors). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Both review authors extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: There were data available from one study included in the review involving 162 women with a multiple pregnancy. For the only reported primary outcome, perinatal mortality, there were no statistically significant differences identified between specialised antenatal care and standard care (risk ratio (RR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.03). Women receiving specialised antenatal care were significantly more likely to birth by caesarean section (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.81). Data was not reported in the study on the following primary outcomes: small-for-gestational age, very preterm birth or maternal death. There were no statistically significant differences identified between specialised antenatal care and standard care for other secondary outcomes examined: postnatal depression (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.20), breastfeeding (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.68), still birth (RR 0.68; 0.12 to 4.04) or neonatal death (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.19 to 22.39). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently limited information available from randomised controlled trials to assess the role of 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy compared with 'standard' antenatal care in improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The value of 'specialised' multiple pregnancy clinics in improving health outcomes for women and their infants requires evaluation in appropriately powered and designed randomised controlled trials.},

Cox regression was used to estimate the relation between any multivitamin use and PTBs (<37 wk) or SGA births (birth weight adjusted for gestational age >2 SDs below the mean on the basis of fetal growth curves). The timing (preconception and postconception) and frequency of use were also analyzed. Regular users (4--6 wk) and partial users (1--3 wk) in each period were compared with nonusers.Results: The association between periconceptional multivitamin use and PTBs varied according to prepregnancy overweight status (P-interaction = 0.07). Regular preconception and postconception multivitamin use in women with a prepregnancy BMI (in kg/m2) <25 was associated with reduced risks of a PTB (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.95) and preterm labor (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.94). No similar associations were shown for overweight women. The adjusted risk of an SGA birth was reduced in multivitamin users regardless of their prepregnancy BMI (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.95), with the strongest association in regular users in the postconception period.Conclusion: Regular periconceptional multivitamin use was associated with reduced risk of SGA births and PTBs in nonoverweight women.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current recommendations for limits on metalworking fluids may provide insufficient protection from workplace-related illness. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a challenging outcome in occupational cohorts because its long period of worsening pulmonary function allows sicker workers to reduce exposure, causing a healthy worker survivor bias. G-estimation is a statistical method that reduces this bias. We introduce a public health approach using g-estimation to compare a series of potential exposure-reducing interventions. METHODS: Autoworkers at three General Motors plants in Michigan were followed for COPD mortality from 1 January 1941 to 31 December 1994. For each of the three fluid types (straight, soluble, synthetic), a series of binary variables indicated whether exposure exceeded a series of potential limits. Separate g-estimation analyses for each limit yielded results expressed as the total number of years of life that could have been saved among those who died from COPD had that exposure limit been enforced. RESULTS: Lower limits would have had greater effect than higher limits. A ban on soluble fluids (the most common type) would have had the greatest effect, saving an estimated 1550 years of life. Corresponding estimates were 737 and 260 years for straight and synthetic fluids, respectively. Few workers were exposed to synthetic fluids, limiting analytic power. CONCLUSIONS: This application of g-estimation suggests that limiting exposure to metalworking fluids could have saved many years of life lost to COPD in this cohort. The approach permits comparison of different interventions. Separate limits should be considered for different types of fluids.},

	abstract = {Healthy worker survivor bias may occur in occupational studies due to the tendency for unhealthy individuals to leave work earlier, and consequently accrue less exposure, compared with their healthier counterparts. If occupational data are not analyzed using appropriate methods, this bias can result in attenuation or even reversal of the estimated effects of exposures on health outcomes. Recent advances in computing power, coupled with state-of-the-art statistical methods, have greatly increased the ability of analysts to control healthy worker survivor bias. However, these methods have not been widely adopted by occupational epidemiologists. We update the seminal review by Arrighi and Hertz-Picciotto (Epidemiology.1994; 5: 186-196) of the sources and methods to control healthy worker survivor bias. In our update, we discuss methodologic advances since the publication of that review, notably with a consideration of how directed acyclic graphs can inform the choice of appropriate analytic methods. We summarize and discuss methods for addressing this bias, including recent work applying g-methods to account for employment status as a time-varying covariate affected by prior exposure. In the presence of healthy worker survivor bias, g-methods have advantages for estimating less biased parameters that have direct policy implications and are clearly communicated to decision-makers.},

@article{Chiolero2008,
	abstract = {Our aim was to critically evaluate the relations among smoking, body weight, body fat distribution, and insulin resistance as reported in the literature. In the short term, nicotine increases energy expenditure and could reduce appetite, which may explain why smokers tend to have lower body weight than do nonsmokers and why smoking cessation is frequently followed by weight gain. In contrast, heavy smokers tend to have greater body weight than do light smokers or nonsmokers, which likely reflects a clustering of risky behaviors (eg, low degree of physical activity, poor diet, and smoking) that is conducive to weight gain. Other factors, such as weight cycling, could also be involved. In addition, smoking increases insulin resistance and is associated with central fat accumulation. As a result, smoking increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and these factors increase risk of cardiovascular disease. In the context of the worldwide obesity epidemic and a high prevalence of smoking, the greater risk of (central) obesity and insulin resistance among smokers is a matter of major concern.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of obesity increased in the United States between 1976-1980 and 1988-1994 and again between 1988-1994 and 1999-2000. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in obesity from 1999 through 2008 and the current prevalence of obesity and overweight for 2007-2008. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of height and weight measurements from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 2007-2008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.6%-36.0%) overall, 32.2% (95% CI, 29.5%-35.0%) among men, and 35.5% (95% CI, 33.2%-37.7%) among women. The corresponding prevalence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI > or = 25) were 68.0% (95% CI, 66.3%-69.8%), 72.3% (95% CI, 70.4%-74.1%), and 64.1% (95% CI, 61.3%-66.9%). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.89-1.32]). For men, there was a significant linear trend (AOR for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.12-1.58]); however, the 3 most recent data points did not differ significantly from each other. CONCLUSIONS: In 2007-2008, the prevalence of obesity was 32.2% among adult men and 35.5% among adult women. The increases in the prevalence of obesity previously observed do not appear to be continuing at the same rate over the past 10 years, particularly for women and possibly for men.},

@article{Torloni2009,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between high prepregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of preterm birth (PTB). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature. We included cohorts and case-control studies published since 1968 that examined the association between BMI and PTB of all types, spontaneous (s), elective and with ruptured membranes (PPROM) in three gestational age categories: general (<37 weeks), moderate (32-36 weeks) and very (<32 weeks) PTB. RESULTS: 20,401 citations were screened and 39 studies (1,788,633 women) were included. Preobese (BMI, 25-29.9) and obese I (BMI, 30-34.9) women have a reduced risk for sPTB: AOR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80-0.92) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.92), respectively. Their risk for moderate PTB was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04-1.38) and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.32-1.94), respectively. Obese II women (BMI, 35-40) have an increased risk for PTB in general (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.12-1.57) moderate (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.46-4.05) and very PTB (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.66-2.31). Obese III women (BMI > 40) have an even higher risk for very PTB (AOR = 2.27, 95%CI: 1.76-2.94). High BMI does not modify the risk for PPROM and increases the risk for elective PTB. CONCLUSIONS: High maternal BMI may have different effects on different types of PTB.},

@article{Catov2007,
	abstract = {The authors' objective was to determine the relation between periconceptional multivitamin use and the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA: <5th percentile; 5th-<10th percentiles) or preterm (<34 weeks; 34-<37 weeks) births. Women in the Pregnancy Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention Study (1997-2001) reported at enrollment their regular multivitamin use in the past 6 months (n=1,823). Women were classified as users or nonusers in multinomial logistic models. After adjustment for race, age, education, enrollment gestational age, and household density, periconceptional multivitamin use was associated with a reduced risk of preterm births (<34 weeks) (odds ratio (OR)=0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 0.64) and spontaneous preterm births (<34 weeks) (OR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.99). Risk of SGA (<5th percentile) was marginally lower (OR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.03) after adjustment for smoking, education, parity, enrollment gestational age, and body mass index. Prepregnancy body mass index modified this relation. Nonobese users had a reduction (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.91) in risk of SGA (<5th percentile); there was no effect among obese women. There was no effect of multivitamin use on risk of preterm births (34-<37 weeks) or SGA (5th-<10th percentiles). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding by folate intake supported these findings. Study results indicate lower rates of severe preterm births and extreme SGA in women who report periconceptional vitamin use, although these should be considered cautiously until replicated.},

@article{Rosenbaum2008,
	abstract = {This article examines health insurance coverage among women of reproductive age and considers how national health insurance reform may affect access to high-quality, timely, and affordable preconception and interconception care. A focus on preconception and interconception care increasingly is understood as essential, not only to the health of women, but to that of infants as well, and thus, as a key part of a comprehensive infant health strategy. After a brief overview that examines the relationship between preconception and interconception health care and health insurance reform, the article examines the current state of health insurance coverage among women of childbearing age and the underlying causes of uninsurance and underinsurance in this population group. The article then sets forth a proposed health insurance reform taxonomy in the context of health and health care generally, and preconception and interconception health care in particular. It is the underlying assumption of this article that preconception and interconception care can serve as bellwethers of the extent to which health reform achieves preventive results. Such results include coverage reforms that not only put acute treatments within financial reach, but that also help finance interventions that can help to achieve population-wide preventive results, in this case, long-term improvement in the health of both women and children.},

@article{Kramer2009,
	abstract = {Very preterm birth (<32 weeks' gestation) occurs in approximately 2{\%} of livebirths but is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the United States. African-American women have a 2-fold to 3-fold elevated risk compared with non-Hispanic white women for reasons that are incompletely understood. This paper reviews the evidence for the biologic and social patterning of very preterm birth, with attention to leading hypotheses regarding the etiology of the racial disparity. A systematic review of the literature in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EMBASE indices was conducted. The literature to date suggests a complex, multifactorial causal framework for understanding racial disparities in very preterm birth, with maternal inflammatory, vascular, or neuroendocrine dysfunction as proximal pathways and maternal exposure to stress, racial differences in preconceptional health, and genetic, epigenetic, and gene-environment interactions as more distal mediators. Interpersonal and institutionalized racism are mechanisms that may drive racially patterned differences. Current literature is limited in that research on social determinants and biologic processes of prematurity has been generally disconnected. Improved etiologic understanding and the potential for effective intervention may come with better integration of these research approaches.},
